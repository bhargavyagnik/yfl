 Method:
Add the washed & soaked tur dal in a pressure cooker along with enough water & turmeric powder, put the lid & pressure cook the dal for 3-4 whistles over high flame.
Once cooked let the cooker depressurize naturally & then take off the lid, whisk the dal well using a whisk, make sure it should become completely smooth & watery.
Set a stock pot over high heat & add oil into it, once the oil gets hot add in the red chillies, mustard seeds, curry leaves, green chilli & garlic, stir well & cook briefly.
Further add asafoetida, tomato, salt & coriander stem, stir well & cook until the tomatoes get mushy.
Add turmeric powder & tamarind pulp along with jaggery & hot water, stir & cook for 3-4 minutes until the raw smell of the tamarind is gone.
Then add the cooked tur dal & hot water to adjust the consistency, rasam is always watery, it is not as thick as sambar.
Let the rasam simmer for 7-8 minutes, if it thickens up then add more hot water to it.
Once you have let the rasam simmer, add rasam powder to a bowl along with a few tablespoons of water, stir well until no lumps remain & add the mixture to the rasam & stir well.
Taste & adjust the salt at this stage & add crushed black peppercorns along with fresh coriander, stir & cook for 2-3 minutes, the rasam is ready. 
Wash the urad dal & soak it for 3-4 hours, once the dal is soaked, drain the excess water & add the soaked urad dal into a mixer grinder jar & grind the dal coarsely  using minimal water (it should be ice cold), the texture of the dal should neither be completely smooth nor extremely coarse.
Further transfer the dal into a bowl & whisk it for 3-4 minutes using your hand or a whisk until it gets light & fluffy.
To check if the batter is ready, add a small portion of it in a bowl of water, if the batter floats, then you can continue with the addition of further ingredients.
Further add salt, ginger, green chilli, asafoetida, curry leaves & mix it very gently.
To fry the vadas, heat the oil in a kadhai until it gets moderately hot or 170 C.
To shape the vadas dip your hand in cold water & scoop out a small bite sized portion of the batter from the bowl & carefully drop it into the hot oil, add other portions similar & then immediately spash hot oil over the vadas so that they puff up & then fry over medium flame while flipping it at regular intervals until light golden brown.
Once the vadas get golden brown & crisp, remove them using a spider & transfer them into a sieve, the vadas are ready.
To serve the rasam vada, add a few vadas in a bowl & pour hot rasam over it, you can also directly add the vadas in the rasam after frying.

In a bowl, add refined flour, salt to taste, oil, mix well & add water gradually, combine the water and flour well, cover it with a clingwrap & rest the dough for 15 minutes.
Further knead it well until smooth, cover it with a damp cloth & rest the dough for anothe hour.
For the filling, in a chopper add garlic, ginger, green chilli, & all the veggies & chop until its fine.
Set a sieve over a bowl & place a muslin cloth in it, transfer the chopped veggie mixture into the muslin cloth & add a large pinch of salt & mix well, let it rest for 2-3 minutes then squeeze out all the excess moisture from the veggies & transfer into a bowl.
Set a pan over high heat, add oil & let it heat up.
Add the chopped veggie mixture along with white & black pepper powder, vinegar & sugar, stir well & cook over high flame for 1-2 minutes then add light soy sauce, red chilli sauce & stir well.
Taste & adjust nay seasoning if required then transfers the mixture into a large bowl & let it cool slightly, then lastly add fresh coriander & spring onion greens & mix well, the veg wonton filling is ready.
To make the garlic chilli oil, add chilli flakes, soy sauce & powdered sugar into a heatproof bowl, mix it well & set it aside.
Further add the oil into a pan & heat it until it reaches 120C, then add in the star anise, cinnamon stick & garlic, stir well & fry over medium flame until the garlic turns light golden brown & crispy.
Once the garlic turns light golden brown, remove the pan from the flame & carefully pour the hot oil over the chilli flakes mixture, stir well & let the chilli oil cool down to room temperature.
Garlic chilli oil is ready.
To make the wonton sheets, divide the dough in four equal parts, coat the dough ball with corn flour & flatten it with hands, further roll the dough using a rolling pin, in a very thin sheet, make sure to dust corn flour every time you roll to avoid the dough from sticking or overlapping.
To check whether your sheet is thin enough, put your hands beneath the sheet, if hands are visible then you can cut the sheet further.
Cut the sheet in 5x5 inch square sheets to make wonton wrappers, place them onto a plate & cover with a cloth, make sure you dust enough corn flour or else the sheets will stick to each other.
Take a wonton wrapper & place a small spoonful the filling in the centre, apply water on the edges and fold it diagonally in triangle & press the edges to seal it completely.
Further apply water on either end (the tips) & bring them together & seal it by pinching it together.
Make as many as you want, and you can keep them frozen in a zip lock bag & use later as and when you want.
Your wontons are ready to be cooked, I am sharing 2 ways to cook & serve them you can choose as per your preference.
To make fried wontons, drop them carefully in moderately hot oil (160-165 C) & fry until crisp & golden brown over medium flame, your fried veg wontons are ready, serve them with sweet chilli sauce.
To make boiled wontons, add the shaped wontons into boiling water & boil them for 5-6 minutes then strain them out.
To serve them in a bowl or a deep plate add chilli oil according to your taste, a dash of light soy sauce & vinegar, a teaspoon of sesame oil, some sesame seeds & hot water, mix well & add the boiled wontons.

Once rested, discard the salt water & rinse them with fresh water & discard the water again.
In a small mixer grinder jar add ginger, garlic, green chilli & some water to grind & make a paste.
To make the batter, add rice flour, corn flour, all the whole spices, salt, green paste, curry leaves, curd into a large bowl & mix well using a whisk, then gradually add water while mixing to make a semi thin batter.
Further add the hot oil & mix well again, the consistency of the batter should not be thick nor too thin, it should coat the cauliflower without dripping.
Add the cauliflower into the batter & coat well.
Fry the coated cauliflower in moderately hot oil (170 C) until light golden brown over medium flame then transfer them into a sieve & let them rest for a few minutes, meanwhile heat the oil slightly more.
Once rested, add the cauliflower back into the hot oil & flash fry them for 30 seconds or until they turn crispy.
Your super crispy cauliflower is ready.
Set a wok over high heat & once it gets hot, add in the oil & let it get hot as well.
Further add garlic, green chilli, curry leaves, stir & cook over high flame for 1-2 minutes then add the fried cauliflower, crushed black peppercorns & toss well.

Method:
Wash & cut the boneless mutton into smaller bite sized pieces if required, this recipe is made best using small pieces of mutton.
Make the tomato pure by grinding the tomatoes & cashews using water as required & keep it aside until further use.
Set a pressure cooker over high flame & oil, let the oil get hot.
Add the cumin seeds along with the onions, stir well & cook over high flame until the onions turn light golden brown.
Further add ginger garlic green chilli paste, stir well & saute it briefly over high flame with the onions.
Then lower the flame & add fresh coriander stems followed by all the powdered spices, stir it & immediately add a splash of hot water then increase the flame to high & cook the spices until the oil separates, it will take about 2-3 minutes.
Further add the tomato & cashew puree, whisked curd, salt & stir well, cook over high flame for 5-6 minutes or until the oil separates.
Then add the mutton, stir well with the masala & cook over high flame for 7-8 minutes, the mutton will release its moisture.
Once you have cooked the mutton over high flame, add hot water, the level of water should bare reach the level of the mutton, you don’t have to submerge the mutton completely in water.
Put the cooker’s lid on & pressure cook the mutton over high flame for 1 whistle then lower the flame to medium low & cook the mutton for 10 minutes, the cooking time of mutton will depend on the quality of the muttons.
Then switch off the flame & let the cooker depressurize naturally.
Check the whistle & then open the lid, stir well & check if the mutton is cooked, if its still underdone then put the lid back on & cook it for a few more minutes, its consistency should be semi thick
Now to cook it further you can use a separate tawa or you can simply just empty the cooker & then use it for the further process.
Set the tawa over high flame & add ghee, let the ghee get hot.
Add garlic, green chilli & ginger, stir well & saute it for 1-2 minutes over high flame.
Now add the mutton, stir well & cooke rover high flame until the gravy reduces & becomes thick enough to coat the mutton pieces.
Taste & adjust seasoning if required & lastly add garam masala, roasted kasuir methi powder, black pepper powder & fresh coriander, mix well.
Your delicious mutton tawa bhuna masala is ready, serve it with rumali roti or pav toasted over direct flame alon with my special chutneys.

CUMIN POWDER | जीरा पाउडर ¼ TSP
WHITE PEPPER POWDER | सफेद मिर्च पाउडर ¼ TSP
LIGHT BROWN SUGAR | लाइट ब्राउन शुगर 1 TSP
LIGHT SOY SAUCE | लाइट सोया सॉस ½ TSP

Method:
To make the red paste add all the ingredients into a mixer grinder jar & grind it into a fine, thick paste. Only 1 tbsp of this paste will be required for the chicken marinade & rest will be used to make the sauce. 
Cut the chicken into thin bite sized pieces & add it into a bowl.
Further add all the ingredients of the marinade, take 4 tbsp of the coconut milk from the 400ml which is required to make the sauce. 
You can let the chicken marinate until you make the sauce or for 1-2 hours.
To make the peanut sauce roast the peanuts in a pan over medium flame until the turn golden brown, then transfer them into a bowl & cool them down completely. 
Once cooked, add the roasted peanuts in a chopper & chop them into a semi coarse powder, it shouldn’t be a fine powder. 
Set a pan over high heat & let it get moderately hot. 
Then add a few ladles of the coconut milk into the pan, stir & cook over medium to high heat for 6-7 minutes of until it thickens.
Then add the remaining red paste, stir well & cook over high flame until the paste turns crumbling
& starts to leave the pan. 
This recipe uses no oil to make the peanut sauce as there is enough oil in the coconut milk (depends on the quality of the coconut milk), but if you don’t see any oil getting released while cooking the paste, you can 1-2 TBSP of neutral oil.
Once the paste is cooked add the remaining coconut milk, stir well & then add the remaining ingredients of the sauce, stir again bring the sauce to a simmer.
Add the roasted peanuts & stir well, cook for 1-2 minutes, taste & adjust seasoning if required.
Your peanut sauce is ready.
To cook the chicken, skewer them on a bamboo stick, you can cook it directly too without skweein. 
Set a pan or a grill over high heat, once it gets hot, add the oil & let the oil heat up as well. 
Carefully place the chicken skewers on the pan & cook over medium high flame on one side until it gets golden brown & gets slightly charred, don’t move the chicken. 
Once cooked from one side flip & cook similarly on the other side, chicken thigh will take 4-5 minutes on each side & breast should only take about 3-4 minutes depending on the quality. 
Make sure you make the peanut sauce before cooking the chicken so that it can be served hot. 
Once cooked remove the skewers from the pan & serve it hot directly with the peanut sauce, you can add a few spoons of the sauce on the skewer itself and serve some more on the side.

Cut the chicken into thin slices & transfer them into a bowl.
Add all the ingredients of the marinade & mix well, you can marinate the chicken at this stage for 1-2 hours or you can also directly cook the chicken.
I personally prefer to skewer the chicken on satay sticks & then cook it, you can cook it without skewering as well.
Set a pan over high heat & let it get moderately hot, then add the oil & let the oil heat up as well.
Place the chicken skewers or pieces carefully on the pan & cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, you don’t have to cook the chicken fully at this stage.
Once you have seared the chicken, transfer it into a bowl & set it aside until you make the gravy.
To make the tomato puree for the gravy, add all the ingredients into a mixer grinder jar & grind it into a fine puree.
Chop the onions, garlic, ginger & green chilli using a chopper.
Set a deep pan or kadhai over high flame, add butter along with the oil & let it get hot.
Further add the cumin seeds, cinnamon, green cardamom & the chopped onion mixture, stir well & cook over high flame until the onions turn golden brown.
Then lower the flame, add turmeric & Kashmiri red chilli powder along with a splash of water, stir well & cook briefly.
Add the tomato pure & salt, stir well & cook over medium high flame for 10-12 minutes or until the gravy stops sticking to the pan.
Once the masala is cooked, add hot water to adjust its consistency, it should be semi thick.
Add the chicken at this stage, stir well & taste the gravy, adjust salt if required & add sugar, stir well & cook over medium low flame for 4-5 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked.
You can adjust the consistency of the gravy as per your preference.
Lastly add fresh cream, butter, roasted kasuri methi powder, garam masala & fresh coriander, mix well.
Your delicious chicken butter masala is ready.

Add the boiled eggs, stir well & then add hot water to adjust the consistency, the gravy should be semi thick, taste & adjust salt if required, this gravy base should taste slightly more salty so that it balances out the flavors once the rice gets added. 
Spread the eggs evenly & add fresh coriander & mint, switch off the flame until you boil the rice. 
Once the water for boiling the rice comes to a rolling boil, add salt as required, make sure that the water tastes like seawater, at this stage you can add whole spices like cumin seeds, green cardamom, bay leaf, black peppercorns, cloves & a slit green chilli if available. 
Further discard the water from the soaked rice & add it into the boiling water & cook for 4-5 minutes, to check the rice just take a few grain & bite them between your teeth, they should have a bite to them, you don’t have to fully cook the rice. 
Once the rice is cooked, switch off the flame, using a spider strain the rice from the water & directly add over the base gravy, make sure you spread it evenly, once you have added all the rice take a fork & use it to even out the rice. 
Lastly add the fresh coriander, mint & ghee. 
Take the lid of the kadhai & wrap it in a clean kitchen towel, place the lid on the kadhai & switch on the flame on low, make sure it’s the smallest burner on the stove. 
Cool then biryani for 10 minutes, then switch off the flame & let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
You can check the biryani once or twice while cooking over dum, just open the lid & then insert the other end of a spoon or a spatula in the biryani & move it gently to creat a small hole, check the surface from that hole, there shouldn’t be any water bubbling,.
Once the biryani has rested you can open the lid & serve it. To serve it properly, use a large flat spatula to first scoop the layer of rice from one edge & put it on the surface.
Then take the masala from the surface, serve it on the plate & add the rice from the top as required.

Add salt as required into the bowl with the gourds & apply it on them, make sure you rub it inside the slit as well, then let it rest for an hour.
After an hour, transfer the bitter gourds into a sieve & wash them well using tap water.

Cut the potatoes in thick sized wedges & onions into thick slices.
Set a kadhai over high heat, add oil & let it get hot.
Add the bitter gourd & fry them over medium to high flame until they turn golden brown while stirring them at regular intervals.
Then add the potato & onions along with salt, stir well & cook over high flame for 2-3 minutes then turn down the flame to low & cook until the onions get caramelized & the potatoes are fully cooked.

Aam Ka Murabba | Raw Mango Murabba | कच्चे आम का मुरब्बा बनाने का तरीका | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe Aam ka Murabba
Prep time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20-25 minutes
Serves: 1.4 kg (approximately)
Ingredients:
RAJAPURI MANGO | राजापुरी आम 1 KG 
SALT | नमक A PINCH 
TURMERIC POWDER | हल्दी 1/2 TSP 
SUGAR | शक्कर 800 GRAMS
WATER | पानी AS REQUIRED 
LEMON JUICE | नींबू का रस 1 TSP
CINNAMON STICK | दालचीनी 4 INCH
CLOVES | लौंग 4 NOS. 
GREEN CARDAMOM | हरी इलायची 4 NOS. (CRUSHED)
SAFFRON | केसर A FEW STRANDS
ALMOND | बादाम 7-8 NOS. (ROUGHLY CHOPPED)
CASHEW | काजू 7-8 NOS. (ROUGHLY CHOPPED)
Method:
Cut the raw mango into medium sized pieces, meanwhile set a stock pot with water over high flame & let the water come to a boil.
Once the water comes to a boil, add the chopped raw mango & add salt & turmeric, boil the mango pieces for 3-4 minutes until they get slightly soft, makes sure you don’t boil until they turn completely mushy.
Once boiled, sieve them using a strainer, you can reserve this water & use it to make dal, sabzis & kadhi, you can also make aam panna.
In a kadhai add the sugar & water, the level of water should only be up to the surface of sugar.
Switch on the flame & cook until the sugar dissolves over high flame, then cook the syrup over medium high until it reaches one string consistency.
To check, pour a couple of drops of the syrup onto a plate & let it cool down slightly, then take some of it on your index finger, press it with you thumb & pull it away repeatedly, a thin string of sugar syrup should form.
Once the sugar syrup reaches one string consistency add boiled raw mango, lemon juice & all the whole spices along saffron & stir well
As the mangoes will release their moisture the sugar syrup will become water, cook over medium high flame until the sugar syrup reaches one string consistency again, check its consistency by pressing the syrup between your thumb & index finger like earlier.
Once the sugar syrup reaches one string consistency again, add the chopped almonds & cashew, stir well & switch off the flame & let it cool down completely.
If you don’t cook the syrup until it reaches one string consistency, the chances of murabba getting spoilt will increase.
Once cooled transfer the murabba into an airtight sterilized glass jar, it will last for upto 12 months if stored properly.

Now take a doughball & place it into a flat surface, press it gently to flatten it a bit & then roll it out into a thick paratha, its edges will tear & its shape will be uneven, you don’t have to try & make it round, it should be 1 cm thick approx. or as you prefer.
During winters if the doughball becomes too stiff to roll you can cook the doughball on the hot tawa from from the sides for a few seconds & then roll it out.
Once you have made a thick koki, use a small knife to make incisions on it, make sure you coat the tip of the knife with some dry flour.
Place the koki on the hot tawa & cook it over low flame until it golden brown spots appear on one side then flip & cook it from the other side similarly, make sure you don’t add any ghee at this stage.
Once brown spots have appeared on both the sides, add ghee & cook the koki until it turns crisp from both the sides.

Meanwhile make the spice mix by adding all the spices into a spice grinder & grind it into a fine powder, you can also use a mortar pestle.
Once the water comes to a boil, switch off the flame & let it cool down until it gets lukewarm.
Add the spice mix into a clean large glass bowl & add curd, mix well to form a paste & then smear the paste onto the surface of the bowl.
To give the kanji a smoky flavour, place a bowl with live charcoal in it in the bowl, add some asafoetida on the coal & then some mustard oil, cover & let the spices smoke for 5 minutes.
Then remove the lid & add the lukewarm water, mix well & thoroughly incorporate the spices.
Cover the bowl using a muslin cloth & tie it, you can also use a mesh lid & place it in a warm place where it can get some sunlight & let it ferment for 3-4 days.
You need to open the lid & stir the kanji at least once every day.
Once fermented the kanji will give off a slight sour & tangy smell, small fragments of mustard seeds will also float on the surface, if you have followed the process carefully & used clean utensils the kanji won’t spoil, discard the kanji is you see a layer of fungus or if it smells foul & rancid.
Your delicious kanji is ready, you can store it in a glass container, it stays in the fridge for upto two weeks.
You can have the kanji as is or you can also have it with some vade.

Method:
Wash the dals well & soak them for 3-5 hours.
Once soaked, drain the water & add the dals in a mixer grinder jar, add the ginger & green chilli & grind it into a paste, make sure that you use minimal water & the paste should not be extremely fine, transfer the paste into a large bowl.
Whisk the mixture really well for 2-3 minutes, the mixture should become fluffy & pale, you can either do it by moving your hand in a circular up & down motion or by using a whisk.
To check if the mixture is ready, scoop up some of it in a spatula or a spoon & flip it upside down, the mixture should not drop.
Once you have whisked the mixture add coarsely crushed coriander seeds & fennel seeds, asafoetida, then in a small ladle heat up the mustard oil & pour it on the spices, then add salt & fresh coriander & gently mix all the ingredients in the batter.
Before frying the vade, make the water that you will be needing to soak the vade after frying, in a large bowl, add lukewarm water, salt & asafoetida & mix it well.
Now to fry the vade, heat oil in a kadhai until its moderately hot or if you have a thermometer, the temperature of the oil should be 170 C.
Dip your hands in ice cold water & scoop out some batter then drop it carefully in the oil, drop a few more portions simalrly, make sure you don’t overcrowd the kadhai.
Fry over medium high heat until light golden brown, once they turn light golden brown remove them from the hot oil using a spider & then immediately transfer them into the water that you prepared for soaking the vade, let them soak for 15-20 minutes or until they sink.
Once soaked, remove the vade from the water & gently squeeze them in your hands to remove all the excess water & transfer them into a bowl.
Your vade are ready.
Transfer the vades into the kanji, chill it in the fridge before serving.

SUGAR | शक्कर 6 TBSP
Method:
Add all the ingredients of the thandai masala into a mixer grinder jar & grind it into a powder using pulse mode, do not keep the grinder on for a longer period of time or else the nuts & the spices will release their oils.
Your instant thandai masala is ready.
To make thandai flavored kulfi base set a heavy bottomed kadhai over high flame & add the milk.
Bring the milk to a boil while stirring it at regular intervals, once the milk comes to a boil set the flame to medium & let the milk simmer until it reduces to half of its original quantity, this process will take up to 45 minutes.
After simmering for 15 minutes while stirring regularly, add thandai masala, stir & continue to cook it further for 15 more minutes, make sure that no lumps of the thandai masala remain.
Then add the sugar, stir & continue to cook for 10 more minutes, the milk will turn thick & grainy at this stage, make sure that the kulfi base doesn’t turn too thick, it should remain in a smoothly flowing consistency.
Switch off the flame & transfer the kulfi base into a bowl & let it cool down completely.
Once cooled pour the base into kulfi moulds, cover the top with a piece of foil paper, make a small slit using a knife & insert an ice cream stick, fill all the moulds similarly.
If you don’t have kulfi moulds then you can simply use paper cups, pour the kulfi base, cover it with foil paper & insert 4 satey sticks or toothpicks.
Set the moulds in the freezer & let them chill for at least 4-5 hours, preferably overnight.
To serve the kulfi from moulds, dip it in room temperature water & gently rub by rolling the mould in between your palms 2-3 times & pull the kulfi out.
To serve kulfi from papercups, cut the papercup using a pair of scissors & then cut the kulfi into quarters.
Your delicious thandai kulfis are ready, you can garnish them with some pistachio powder & dry rose petals.

To make the kofta, grate & add the paneer into a large parat (plate) & with the use of the heel of your palm mash it until it becomes smooth & comes together like a dough, make sure to not over - mash otherwise the ghee will separate. 
Once the paneer is mashed & comes together like a dough, crumble & add the Mawa into the parat & mash it similarly.

Fry the koftas in 150-155°C hot oil, just make sure that before adding the koftas, stir the hot oil gently using a spoon & then carefully drop 3-4 koftas at a time, once you have added all the koftas keep stirring the oil using the spoon gently so that all the koftas will fry evenly. 
Fry the koftas over medium to low flame.
Once fried transfer the koftas into a sieve using a spider so that all the excess oil drips off. 
Your delicious koftas are also ready. 
Do not cook the koftas along with the gravy, serve them by puouring the gravy in a bowl and add the koftas to it & enjoy",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn1UeCKOACU

Kala Jamun Recipe | Tips for Perfect Kala Jamun | परफेक्ट काला जामुन | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Kala Jamun
Prep time: 10-15 minutes
Cooking time: 45-50 minutes
Serves: 16 large kala jamuns

Ingredients:
Chaasni (sugar syrup)
• SUGAR | शक्कर 4 CUPS
• WATER | पानी 3 CUPS 
• SAFFRON | केसर 3-4 STRANDS
• ROSE WATER | गुलाब जल 1 TBSP
• GREEN CARDAMOM | हरी इलायची 3 NOS. 
• LEMON JUICE | नींबू का रस ½ TSP
Doug
• HARIYALI MAWA | हरियाली मावा 250 GRAMS 
• MALAI PANEER | मलाई पनीर 65 GRAMS 
• POWDERED SUGAR | पीसी हुई शक्कर 1 TSP
• BAKING POWDER | बेकिंग पाउडर ¼ TSP
• REFINED FLOUR | मैदा 3 TBSP
Method:
• To make the chaasni add sugar & water into a deep pan, set it over high flame & stir until all the sugar dissolves.
• Add all the remaining ingredients of the syrup & let it boil for 4-5 minutes, the syrup shouldn’t become to thick, it should feel slightly sticky when pressed between fingers.
• Once the sugar syrup is cooked set it aside, let the temperature drop on its own. Make sure to keep the syrup warm.
• In a big size thal and add the mawa, if the mawa is little tough, use a grater & great to break down or else you could directly start to cream (mathna) the mawa, using the base of your palm. 
• Cream the mawa until its smooth and creamy in texture, there should be no grains in the mawa, you need to do this process for at least 15 minutes or until the entire batch of the mawa is smooth.
• After creaming the mawa, take the malai paneer and grate using a small size hole, you have to cream the paneer as well in the same way as done for mawa, cream it well until its smooth in texture.
• Once they both are smooth in texture, mix well & combine the paneer & Mawa to form a dough, then add the powdered sugar, baking powder & add maida in batches, make sure not to add them all at once, the quantity of maida will differ depending on the moisture level in the paneer and mawa, so just add in batches, you need to add & mix well until it forms like a dough and it starts to leave the parath or thal. This recipe, with this quantity won’t require more than 4 or 5 or 6 tbsp of flour.
• Make sure that you don’t knead the dough a lot otherwise it will start losing all the fats & become greasy. 
• Cover & rest the dough for 10-15 minutes & cover with a cloth, by the time you can make the chaashni.
• Once the dough has rested, divide it into equal portions, I have divided them into 22 grams portions which will make 16 kala jamuns.
• Roll the portions into smooth & crack free roundels, make sure you keep them covsre using a damp cloth. 
• To fry the jamuns, heat oil in a kadhai until it reaches 150-155° C (moderately hot).
• Also check the temperature of the chaasni, it should remain warm (50 ° C), you can also check by dipping your finger into the chaasni, it should be comfortably warm. 
• Swirl the hot oil with a large spoon to create a whirlpool, make sure to do it carefully and not spilling the hot oil over your hands, stir and add the gulab jamun balls but the spoon not touching them or else they may break, take help if required, fry in batches and do not overcrowd the kadhai.
• Fry them on low flame maintaining the temperature and keep stirring so that they get even colour and cook evenly from the inside as well.
• Once they become light golden brown, keep stirring them & continue frying until they become brown. 
• Further increase the flame to medium high & fry until they turn dark brown, almost blackish.
• Then remove them from the hot oil using a large spider & dunk them into the warm chaasni, gently press them into the chaasni using a ladke or pour chaasni on top of them.
• Fry the oththe batch similarly & add them to the chaasni as well.
• Let the kala jamuns soak in the chaasni for at least 1 hour, preferably for 3-4 hours, they’ll get even bigger once the soak the syrup properly.
• Serve them with or without chaasni.

Eggless Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe | बिना अंडे की चॉकलेट चिप कुकी | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Chocolate Chip Cookies (eggless)
Prep time: 10-15 minutes
Cooking time: 20-25 minutes (excluding chilling time)
Serves: 12 cookies (60 grams each)

Ingredients:
UNSALTED BUTTER | अंसाल्टेड बटर 1/2 CUP / 115 GRAMS (MELTED)
CASTER SUGAR | कैस्टर शुगर 1/2 CUP / 110 GRAMS
LIGHT BROWN SUGAR | लाइट ब्राउन शुगर 1/2 CUP / 110 GRAMS
WATER | पानी 2 TBSP / 30 ML
OIL | तेल 1 TSP / 5 ML 
BAKING POWDER | बेकिंग पाउडर 1 TSP / 4 GRAMS
VANILLA ESSENCE | वैनिला एसेंस 1 TSP / 5 ML
REFINED FLOUR | मैदा 1 + 1/3 CUPS / 190 GRAMS
CORN FLOUR | कॉर्न फ्लोर 1 TBSP / 8 GRAMS
BAKING SODA | बेकिंग सोड़ा 1/2 TSP / 3 GRAMS
SALT | नमक 1/2 TSP / 3 GRAMS
DARK CHOCOLATE | डार्क चॉकलेट 3/4 - 1 CUP / 150 GRAMS 
FLAKEY SALT | फ्लैकी सॉल्ट A PINCH (OPTIONAL)
Method:
Add the melted butter, caster sugar & light brown sugar into a large bowl & mix until everything combines.
Further add the water, oil & baking powder in a separate bowl & whisk well, add this mixture into the butter & sugar along with vanilla essence, whisk well until everything comes together. This mixture is a substitute for egg, if you consume eggs then replace it with 1 whole egg.
Once you wet mixture is ready, sieve in the refined flour, corn flour, baking soda & salt, mix well using a spatula until all the ingredients combine.
After the cookie dough comes together, roughly chop & add in the dark chocolate chunks & mix well, I prefer using chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips as they give a better result, if you are using chocolate chips then add 1 cup or 170 grams. Your chocolate chip cookie dough is ready.
Portion out the dough using a scooper or using a spoon & your hands into 60 gram cookie doughballs, you can adjust the size as per your preference.
Once you have shaped all the cookie doughballs, cover them using a cling film & set them in the fridge for 45 minutes to an hour.
Preheat the oven to 175C.
Once the cookie doughballs have set, place them onto a butter paper lined baking tray, make sure to place them 2-3 inches apart as they will spread & bake them for 10-12 minutes.
Remove the tray from the oven once the cookies have baked & sprinkle some flakey salt & let the cookies cool down for 8-10 minutes, do not move or lift them while they are still hot or else, they will collapse.
Your delicious & perfect chocolate chip cookies are ready.

Serves: 15-16 vadas

Ingredients:

For batter:

Water as required
For kharda (chilli garlic paste):
Garlic 5-6 cloves
Ginger a small piece

A pinch of salt
For thecha (spicy green chutney):

Green chillies 5-6 nos. (adjust spiciness according to your preference)
Garlic 5-6 cloves
Ginger ½ inch
Salt to taste
Water as required

For aloo mixture:
Oil 2 tbsp
Rai (mustard seeds) 1/4th tsp
Jeera (cumin seeds) ½ tsp
Hing (asafoetida) 1/4th tsp
Kadi patta (curry leaves) 8-10 nos.
Kharda (made earlier)
Turmeric powder ½ tsp
Salt to taste
Garam masala a pinch
Potatoes 8-10 medium size (boiled & mashed)
Lemon juice 1 tbsp
Fresh coriander a handful (chopped)

For red vada pav chutney:
Chura 2 cups
Garlic 8-10 cloves (with skin)
Salt to taste
Red chilli powder 2 tbsp
Oil for frying the chura & vadas

Assembly:
Crispy vadas
Pav
Thecha
Sweet chutney
Chopped onions
Fried salted green chillies (as required)

Method:
For batter, in a mixing bowl, add the besan & other ingredients of the batter and mix well, add water gradually to make a smooth batter make sure there should not be any lumps. 
Use a whisk to whisk the batter nicely, whisk for at least 4-5 minutes, makes sure the consistency of the batter should not be too thick or too thin, it should be in flowy consistency.
Once whisked well, let the batter rest for a minimum time of 15-20 minutes, by the time the batter rest you can make other components.
For kharda, add all the ingredients in a mortar pestle or in a grinding jar and grind to make a paste. Keep aside to be used later while making the aloo mixture.
For thecha, add all the ingredients in a mortar pestle or in a grinding jar and grind to make a paste, make sure to add little water while grinding, even if the chutney is coarse its totally fine. Keep in the fridge to serve later with vada pav.
For the aloo mixture, set a wok or a pan on medium heat, add oil and let the oil heat further add jeera & rai and let them crackle. Once they start to crackle, add the hing, kadi patta & the kharda made earlier, mix and cook on medium flame for 1-2 minutes. 
Further add turmeric powder, garam masala & salt, stir briefly for 30 seconds on low heat, further add boiled potatoes, increase the flame to medium heat & cook for 2-3 minutes, further add some lemon juice & freshly chopped coriander leaves, mix & cook for last 5-6 minutes. Aloo mixture is ready, keep aside to cool down to room temperature.
For making the vada pav red chutney, we need to first make the chura, for that, set oil in wok on medium heat, take the vada pav batter & give a mix, dip your fingers in the batter and randomly drizzle and drop in hot oil, deep fry on medium high heat until its crisp & golden brown in colour, make sure that the chura is not too thick. Keep aside to cool down.
You also need fried garlic, first pick the garlic with toothpick and deep fry briefly for 30-60 seconds, remove and keep aside to be used in making the vada pav chutney.
For vada pav chutney, add 2 cups crispy chura in a food processor, along with fried garlic, salt & red chilli powder, use pulse mode and grind to fine powder. Your red vada pav chutney is ready, serve with vada pav, you can also store in an airtight container and store in the fridge for up to a week. 
As now all the major component for vada pav is ready, let’s make hot crispy vadas, first start by shaping, take a spoonful of aloo mixture and roughly shape in ball, further lightly flatten with hands, shape all the vadas in same way.
Set oil on medium heat for deep frying, whisk the batter once again & further coat the vadas with the besan batter, use your thumb to even out the coating & slide the besan coated vada balls in hot oil for deep frying, deep fry in hot oil on medium high flame until the vadas take their shape, further low down the heat and fry until they are crispy & golden brown in colour, fry all the vadas in same way, crispy hot vadas are ready. 
For fried green chillies, take as many green chillies you would like to have with vada pav, now make a slit with a knife without dividing in half, now, briefly fry the slit green chillies for 15-20 seconds & immediately coat with salt and serve with hot crispy vada pav. 
To serve, slit the pav in two, apply the thecha or sweet chutney as per your preference, add vada pav red sukha chutney, place the hot crispy vadas add some chopped onions and close, serve immediately with fried salted green chillies. Also add some chura for that extra crispiness. You can tweak the addition of elements like chutney as per your preference.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7X5Q04s1oW8

Set a pan on high heat & let it get hot, then lower the flame & add almonds, cashew & pistachio, dry roast the nuts over low heat for a couple of minutes until they turn slightly golden brown, make sure you keep stirring them so that they dry roast equally & don’t burn.
Further, take the pan off of the heat, transfer the nuts into a bowl & cool them down completely, this step is very important.
Now in a chopper or a mixer grinder (I prefer to use a chopper for this because it helps to maintain the right texture) add the roasted nuts, green cardamom (only seeds), black pepper powder, ginger powder, nutmeg (grated), saffron & turmeric powder, grind the nuts & the spices into a coarse powder.
The home-made masala milk is ready. Store it in a clean airtight container and refrigerate it. Stays good for a couple of months if stored correctly.

Further lower the heat to medium / low depending on burner & add the masala milk powder, stir well & cook for 8-10 minutes until the milk thickens up. (If you don’t prefer to have thick milk then you can just simmer the milk for 2-3 minutes after adding the masala milk powder & then serve it)
After the milk reduces & thickens add in the sugar (or the sweetener of your choice) stir well & simmer for 2 minutes.
Your delicious & comforting hot masala milk is ready.
If you want to serve it cold then transfer the milk into a bowl & let it cool down to room temperature then place it in the refrigerator for a couple of hours until chilled, your cold masala milk is ready.

Method:
Add the wheat flour & salt in a bowl & mix well, then add water as required & mix well with your hands, once all the dry flour combines, knead it to form a semi soft dough, then add the oil & knead it again until the oil gets incorporated.
Once the dough is ready drizzle a few drops of oil to cover the surface of the dough & cover it with a damp cloth, let the dough rest for half an hour.
To make the radish filling, cut the leaves of the radish (you can use these to make a nutritious sabzi, don’t throw it away), peel them & further grate them using a large hole grater.
Add the pinch of salt to the grated radish & mix well, let it rest for a few minutes then squeeze out all the excess water in the radish & transfer it into a bowl.
Add the ginger, green chilli & all the remaining ingredients off the filling & mix well, you can let the filling rest ofr a few more minutes at this stage & squeeze out more moisture.
To shape the paratha, take a portion of the dough & form it into a roundel then press it slightly, further form it into a bowl like shape by using your thumbs & rotation it.
Then fill it with a generous amount of the radish filling & carefully bring the edges of the dough together to seal it, make sure to pinch out the excess dough.
Further coat the stuffed dough ball with dry wheat flour & then roll it out into a semi-thin paratha using a rolling pin, dust wheat flour as required.
You can also shape it in an alternate method, form two roundels of the dough & roll them into thick discs, make sure to keep one disc slightly larger than the other.
Then place the stuffing on the smaller sized disc & place the other disc on top, seal the edges, then flip it & roll it into a paratha.
To cook the paratha, heat the tawa really well then add the ghee & wipe it off using a clean napkin or a paper towel.
Then place the paratha on the tawa & cook it by pressing the paratha with a napkin while continuously rotating, cook the paratha from both the sides over high flame.
Further apply ghee on the paratha & cook it briefly until light golden brown over medium to low flame.
Your mooli ka paratha is ready, serve it hot with some white butter, pickle & curd.

GRAM FLOUR | बेसन 2 TBSP
WHITE SESAME SEEDS | सफेद तिल 2 TSP

WATER | पानी AS REQUIRED OR 2-3 TBSP (ADDED GRADUALLY)
OIL | तेल A DASH
For Cooking
WHEAT FLOUR | गेहूं का आटा
OIL | तेल AS REQUIRED 
Method:
Take a bunch of fresh methi & sort it by separating the leaves from the stalks, transfer all the methi leaves into a sieve, you need about 80 grams of methi leaves for this recipe.
Wash the methi leaves using water 2-3 times until its clean, drain out all the excess water & transfer the washed leaves on a clean kitchen towel & pat dry it using another kitchen towel or tissue until its dry.
Further finely chop the methi, you will get around 1.5 cups of chopped methi, transfer the chopped methi into a large bowl.
Further add the wheat flour, glam flour & all the remaining ingredient of the dough except for the water & mix well.
Then gradually add water, a tablespoon at once & knead a semi-soft dough, make sure that the dough is not too stiff or too soft, you will only require 2-3 tbsp of water depending on the moisture in the curd, you can sprinkle some wheat flour & gram flour if the dough gets too moist to adjust the consistency.
Once a semi-soft dough forms, shape it into a round doughball & drizzle some oil to coat the surface, cover & let the dough rest for 10 minutes.
After the dough has rested, divide it into equal sized portions & form it into small roundels, keep them in a large bowl & cover them while you roll out the theplas.
Take a roundel, coat it using wheat flour & roll it out into a thin thepla, you can dust more wheat flour if required.
Roll out 4-5 theplas or as required & stack them onto a clean kitchen towel.
Set a tawa over high heat & let it get hot.
Place the thepla on the hot tawa & cook briefly from both the sides by flipping it 1-2 times over high flame.
Then add oil & cook again from both sides quickly, make sure that the flame is high throughout the process, if the thepla stays on the tawa for a long time then it will crisp up & not remain soft.
Your soft & delicious thepla is ready, cook all the theplas similarly & serve them with some chunda, mango pickle & curd.

BIRISTA OIL | बिरिस्ता वाला तेल 3 LADLES
CORIANDER POWDER | धनिया पाउडर 1 TBSP
HOT WATER | पानी AS REQUIRED
KEWRA WATER | केवड़ा पानी1 TSP
Method:
Set a deep pan over high flame & pour in the oil to fry the onions, heat the oil until it gets moderately hot, you don’t have to take a lot of oil, when the sliced onions are added the oil should barely come up to the surface of the onions.
Add the sliced onions into the oil & stir well, fry the onions until they turn light golden brown while stirring them frequently, you will need to adjust the flame as the onions starts to change their colour, make sure that the temperature is not too high or else the onions will fry from the outside but won’t lose their moisture which will result into soggy birista.
Once the onions are almost about to turn light golden brown, remove them from the hot oil using a spider & squeeze out the excess oil by pressing it using a spatula then transfer the fried onions onto a tissue paper lined plate & separate them apart using forks, dab them from the top using a tissue paper if required to remove all the remaining excess oil.
Let the fried onions rest for a couple of minutes & your birista is ready, reserve the oil in which the birista was fried.
Crush the onions as fine as possible using your hands & set them aside until further use, you don’t have to make a paste using a mixer grinder.
To make the spice mix add all the whole spices into a spice grinder & grind it into a powder, it doesn’t need to be a fine powder, you can also grind them using a mortar & pestle.
To make the korma transfer the chicken into a large handi, if there are any leg pieces then make sure that you cut the tendon on the bone.
Further add the curd, all the powdered spices, green cardamom, cloves, ginger garlic paste, salt & birista oil.
Then set the handi over high flame & stir well to mix all the ingredients.
Cook the chicken over high flame for 5-7 minutes until the chicken releases its moisture then cover & cook over medium low flame for 4-5 more minutes until the chicken releases all of its moisture, the gravy will become runny at this stage.
You only have to cook the chicken until it's 70% done, then remove the chicken pieces from the handi using a large spider & transfer it into a separate bowl until you cook the gravy.
Turn the flame back to high & add the crushed fried onions into the gravy along with the coriander powder & stir well.
Cook the gravy for 25-30 minutes until it turns grainy, you can add hot water as required if the gravy becomes too dry at any stage.
Once the gravy turns grainy, add the chicken & stir well, once the gravy comes to a simmer again cover & cook the chicken over low flame until it's fully cooked.
Then remove the lid & add the spice mix & kewra water, stir well.
At this stage you can taste & adjust the seasoning if required.
Your delicious chicken korma is ready.

Lacchedar Rabdi Recipe | प्योर दूध से बनाइयें हलवाई जैसी लच्छेदार रबड़ी | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Lacchedar Rabdi

Prep time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 35-40 minutes
Serves: 5-6 people

Ingredients:
MILK | दूध 1.5 LITRES
SUGAR | शक्कर 3 TBSP / 50 GRAMS
Method:
To make lacchedar rabdi a large kadhai is very important as you get more surface area to follow & replicate the process that the halwais do.
Also make sure that it’s a heavy bottomed vessel so that the milk doesn’t burn from the bottom.
Pour the milk into the kadhai & switch on the gas flame to high.
Keep stirring the milk at regular intervals & bring it to a boil.
After the milk comes to a boil, lower the flame to medium & wait briefly until a layer of malai (fat) forms on the surface of the milk, it will only take a couple of seconds.
Once that layer of malai forms, pull it towards the side using a satay stick or fork or a spatula & stick it on the surface of the kadhai.
You can also use a hand fan or a flat plate to air the surface for the malai to form faster.
Make sure that you don’t stir the milk at all & you also don’t have to mix the malai stuck to the sides until the milk reduces to 1/3 of its quantity, until then keep repeating this process.
Once the milk has reduced to 1/3 then add the sugar & then stir the milk to dissolve the sugar, do not mix the thick layer of malai that has formed on the sides just yet.
Once the sugar dissolves, scrape the malai from the sides using a spatula & add it into the milk, avoid the slightly browned parts from the sides.
Further mix the malai very gently into the milk & cook for 2-3 minutes over high flame, at this stage it might seem like the rabdi is too thin & runny, but it will thicken up nicely once it cools down, a good rabdi should also have a little bit of milk along with the lacche of malai.
Transfer the rabdi into a bowl & place it in the fridge after it comes down to room temperature.
Your lacchedar rabdi is ready, serve it once chilled & garnish it with some slivered nuts & dry rose petals, you can have it as it is or pair it with some hot & crispy jalebis, gulab jamuns or make rabdi falooda.

Ingredients:
DAHI | दही 200 GRAMS
MUSTARD OIL | सरसों का तेल 1 TSP
CASHEW PASTE | काजू की पेस्ट OF 15 CASHEWS
FRESH CREAM | फ्रेश क्रीम 2 TBSP
GINGER GARLIC & GREEN CHILLI PASTE
GARLIC | लेहसुन 6 CLOVES
GINGER | अदरक 1/2 INCH 
GREEN CHILLI | हरी मिर्च 2 NOS.
POWDERED SPICES
CORIANDER POWDER | धनिया पाउडर 1 TSP
CUMIN POWDER | जीरा पाउडर 1/2 TSP
CHAAT MASALA | चाट मसाला 1/2 TSP
BLACK SALT | काला नमक 1/4 TSP
WHITE PEPPER POWDER | सफेद मिर्च पाउडर 1/4 TSP
ROASTED KASURI METHI POWDER | भुनी हुई कसूरी मेथी का पाउडर 1/4 TSP
GARAM MASALA | गरम मसाला 1/4 TSP
SALT | नमक TO TASTE
LIVE CHARCOAL | कोयला 
GHEE | घी 
PANEER | पनीर 500 GRAMS
CAPSICUM | शिमला मिर्च AS REQUIRED (DICED)
ONION | प्याज़ AS REQUIRED (PETALS)
Method:
To make hung curd add the curd into a muslin cloth & squeeze out all the excess moisture, then place it in a sieve & place a small weight on it & let it rest for 25-30 minutes.
Further transfer the hung curd into a large plate & add mustard oil, cashew paste, fresh cream, ginger garlic & green chilli paste, all the powdered spices, salt & mix the marinade using your hand, make sure there are no lumps.
You can also give the marinade a smoky flavour by using live charcoal & ghee, this step is completely optional, place a piece of live charcoal in a small bowl & place it on the marinade, then pour a spoonful of ghee & cover the bowl using a lid & let it smoke for 3-4 minutes then take off the lid.
Cut the paneer into tikkas & also prep the capsicum & onion similarly.
To replicate the tandoor texture, I prefer to cook paneer tikka over direct flame using metal skewers.
Insert the onion petal onto the skewer, then coat the cut paneer with the marinade & insert it into the skewer followed by a diced piece of capsicum then alternate the same sequence until there are 4-5 pieces of paneer on the skewer, prep all the skewers similarly.
After skewering, cook them on open flame to get the charred texture, this method will replicate the tandoor.
Once charred, remove the skewer from the flame & serve.
Your delicious afghani paneer tikkas are ready, sprinkle some chaat masala & squeeze a bit of lemon while serving.
To cook these in an airfryer, preheat the air fryer on 200 C for 10-15 minutes, then skewer the paneer & the veggies similarly on a bamboo skewer.
Place a piece of foil in the air fryer & keep the skewered paneer tikkas, air fry for 10-12 minutes then apply butter & again let it cook for a few minutes until charred marks appear.

Lauki Ka Halwa Recipe | No Mawa Recipe | बिना मावा लौकी का हलवा बनाने का तरीका | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe of Lauki Ka Halwa

Prep time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 45-50 minutes
Serves: 3-4 people

Ingredients:
MILK | दूध 1 LITRE (FULL FAT)
BOTTLE GOURD | लौकी 1 NO. (750 GRAMS)
GHEE | घी 3 TBSP 
SUGAR | शक्कर 100 - 120 GRAMS
GREEN CARDAMOM POWDER | हरी इलायची पाउडर A PINCH
GHEE | घी 1 TBSP
CHIRONJI | चिरोंजी 1 TSP
ALMOND | बादाम 5-6 NOS. (SLIVERED)
CASHEW | काजू 5-6 NOS. (ROUGHLY CHOPPED)

Method:
Add the milk into a deep pan & set it over medium flame on the side first, so that by the time you grate & cook the bottle gourd, the milk will get hot.
Now peel the bottle gourd & trim its top & bottom off.
Further cut it into two halves from the centre then divide them into quarters & trim the seeds portion of the bottle gourd.
Grate the flesh of the gourd using a large hold grater, make sure you do this step with a good speed because bottle gourd oxidizes very fast & it will turn dark.
Once you have grated the bottle gourd, quickly set a kadhai over high heat, add the ghee & let the ghee get hot.
Further transfer the grated gourd into the kadhai, stir well & cook it over medium flame until it turns translucent, this process will take 4-5 minutes, make sure that you don’t cook for too long otherwise its colour will change.
Once it turns translucent, carefully pour in the heated milk then stir well.
Now you have to cook it over medium high flame until all the milk reduces & it turns into a semi-thick mixture, this process will take upto 45 minutes, while its cooking you will need to stir it at frequent intervals.
Once the milk reduces to 1/3 of its original quantity, keep stirring it until a semi thick mixture forms.
Further add the sugar & cardamom powder, upon stirring the halwa will loosen up a bit again due to the moisture from the sugar, keep stirring & cook until the halwa thickens up again.
Switch off the flame once the halwa thickens up, set a small pan over high flame on the side & add ghee, let the ghee heat it up.
Add chironji, almonds & cashews, stir & fry them over medium flame until they light golden brown then transfer them into the halwa & mix well.
Your delicious & rich lauki ka halwa is ready.

Method:
Transfer the dal into a large bowl & wash it using a fresh water a couple of times until the added water stays clear, then cover it let it soak for 6-8 hours.
Take small muslin cloth & add green cardamom, black cardamom & all the remaining whole spices & tie it up.
Discard the water from the dal & add the soaked dal into a pressure cooker, add the whole spices bag, salt & water, put the lid on & pressure cook the dal over medium high flame for 3 whistles, then switch off the flame & let the cooker depressurize naturally.
Open the lid & check if the dal is cooked properly, it should be fully cooked, but it should also stay intact for the best texture, your boiled dal is ready, set it aside until you make the tempering.
Set a kadhai over high heat & let it get hot, then add the oil & ghee, let the oil get hot as well.
Further add cumin seeds & onions, stir well & cook over medium until the onion turns light golden brown.
Once the onion turn light golden brown add the garlic, ginger & green chilli, stir well & continue to cook until the onion turns completely golden brown.
Then lower the flame & add all the powdered spices, stir & immediately add a splash of hot water, stir & increase the flame & cook the spices for 3-4 minutes.
Further lower the flame again & the whisked curd, salt & stir it continuously, then increase the flame again & cook until the oil gets separated.
Once the oil gets separated, add in the boiled dal & stir well, add hot water & adjust the consistency, add plenty of hot water, it will thicken up ass the dal cooks further, stir well again & set the flame to medium & let it cook until you make the birista.
Set a deep pan over high flame & pour in the oil to fry the onions, heat the oil until it gets moderately hot.
Add the sliced onions into the oil & stir well, fry the onions until they turn light golden brown while stirring them frequently, you will need to adjust the flame as the onions starts to change their colour, make sure that the temperature is not too high or else the onions will fry from the outside but won’t lose their moisture which will result into soggy birista.
Once the onions are almost about to turn light golden brown, remove them from the hot oil using a spider & squeeze out the excess oil by pressing it using a spatula then transfer the fried onions onto a tissue paper lined plate & spread them apart using forks, dab them from the top using a tissue paper if required to remove all the remaining excess oil.
Let the fried onions rest for a couple of minutes & your birista is ready, divide it into 80% & 20%, we’ll add the larger quantity into the dal & use the remaining for garnish.
Check the dal at this stage, stir well & check its consistency.
Crush & add the birista along with fresh cream, butter, roasted kasuri methi powder & garam masala, stir well.
Taste & adjust the salt at this stage & lastly add fresh coriander.
Your dal Mughlai is ready, serve it with laccha paratha (or any Indian bread of your choice) & rice.

Transfer the red chillies into a bowl, cool them down completely & add them into a mixer grinder jar.

Vada
Ingredients:
CHANA DAL | चना दाल 1 CUP
GINGER | अदरक 2 INCH
GARLIC | लेहसुन 6-8 CLOVES
GREEN CHILLI | हरी मिर्च 2-3 NOS.
CUMIN SEEDS | जीरा ½ TSP
CORIANDER SEEDS | साबुत धनिया 1 TSP
FENNEL SEEDS | सौंफ ½ TSP
BLACK PEPPERCORNS | साबुत काली मिर्च ½ TSP
ONION | प्याज़ 1 NO. (CHOPPED)
SALT | नमक TO TASTE
CURRY LEAVES | कड़ी पत्ता 3-4 SPRIGS (CHOPPED)
FRESH CORIANDER | हरा धनिया A HANDFUL (CHOPPED)
RICE FLOUR | चावल का आटा 1 TBSP
HOT OIL | गरम तेल 1 TBSP
ASAFOETIDA | हींग A PINCH
Method:
Wash the chana dal 3-4 times in fresh water & then soak it for 7-8 hours or overnight. 
Once soaked, discard the water & add the chana dal into a mixer grinder jar, reserve 20% or a few tablespoons of the chana dal, we’ll add this later for a better texture.
Further add ginger, garlic & green chilli into the jar & grind it until you get a coarse chana dal paste, use pulse mode to grind the dal & open the jar twice or thrice to mix the ingredients for even grinding as there’s no additional water added.
Transfer the coarse paste into a large bowl, then add all the whole spices into a mortar & grind them into a coarse spice mix, you can also use a spice grinder just make sure that you don’t turn it into a fine powder.
Add the spice mix into the dal mixture followed by the reserved chana dal, chopped onion, salt, chopped curry leaves, fresh coriander, rice flour, hot oil & asafoetida, mix & combine all the ingredients with your hands to form a mixture.
To shape the vadas, take a desired portion of the mixture & form it into a roundel then press it gently between your palms to flatten it, the edges should be slightly thinner that the middle portion, that will form the crispy edge which tastes really good in a dal vada.
Shape all the vadas similarly & then carefully drop them into 165 C preheated oil, don’t stir the vadas for the initial minute or two, let them hold their shape & then stir & fry them over medium flame until crisp & golden brown.
Once fried transfer them into a sieve so that all the excess oil drips off.
Your delicious, monsoon perfect dal vadas are ready.

Method:
To make the wet paste for sambar, set a pan over high flame & when it gets hot add the oil.
Once the oil gets hot add asafoetida, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, urad dal, chana dal, black peppercorns & coriander seeds, stir & cook them briefly over medium flame.
Further add curry leaves, kashmiri red chillies, ginger, garlic, green chilli, shallots, fenugreek seeds, fresh coconut, stir well & saute all the ingredients for 2-3 minutes then transfer the mixture into a bowl & cool it down completely.
Once cooled, transfer the mixture into a mixer grinder jar, add water as required & grind it into a fine, smooth paste & your wet sambar paste is ready.
Wash & soak the tur dal for 30 minutes to an hour, discard the water once soaked & add the dal into a pressure cooker along with water, salt & turmeric powder, then put the lid on & pressure cook the dal over medium high flame for 3-4 whistles.
Once cooked, switch off the flame & let the cooker de-pressurize naturally.
Further open the lid & whisk the dal using a whisk until you get a watery, smooth dal.
To make sambar, set a stock pot over high heat, add oil & let it get hot.
Once the oil gets hot, add mustard seeds, cumin seeds & onions, stir well & cook over high flame until the onions turn translucent.
Then lower the flame & add tomatoes, turmeric powder, kashmiri red chilli powder, stir well & cook for 1-2 minutes.
Further add hot water, stir well & add all the veggies, salt, sambar paste & cooked dal, stir well & bring the sambar to a boil.
Once the sambar comes to a boil, cover the stock pot with a lid & cook over medium low flame for 20-25 minutes.
After cooking for 20-25 minutes, the colour of sambar will darken up a bit & it will also get slightly thicker.
Further taste & adjust the salt, then add tamarind pulp, jaggery, stir well cook for 1-2 minutes until the jaggery dissolves.
Then taste the sambar again to adjust the sourness & sweetness.
Set a small pan over high flame on a separate flame, add oil & let it get hot.
Once the oil gets hot, add the lady fingers & toss over high flame for 2 minutes then add them into the sambar.
Set the same pan on the flame again, oil along with chanda dal, stir & cook the chana dal briefly, then add mustard seeds, red chilli, fenugreek seeds, curry leaves & asafoetida, stir quickly & then immediately pour the tadka over the sambar & cover it with a lid.

Method:
For dough, add refined flour, semolina, salt, carom seeds and ghee, in a mixing bowl, mix well until combined well, make sure to crush the ajwain between your palms to enhance the flavour, the texture should be somewhere similar to breadcrumbs & should stick when pressed.
Add cold water gradually in the flour and knead a stiff & tight dough, knead the dough well for 7-8 minutes, after kneading cover the dough with a damp cloth and rest for 30 minutes. By the time you can prepare the filling.
For filling, we need to make the ginger & green chilli paste, for that, add green chillies & ginger in a grinding jar and grind into a fine paste, keep the paste aside to be used later in making the filling.
Further, take a mortar & pestle, add cumin seeds, coriander seeds, & fennel seeds and grind to a coarse powder, you can also grind the spices in a mixer grinder, keep the powder aside to be used later in making the filling.
Cut the boiled potatoes in quarters and further slice them, keep aside for making filling.
Set a pan or a wok on low heat, add ghee, further add the grounded spices & briefly cook on low heat for 30-40 seconds, now add the ginger chilli paste, stir & cook for 1-2 minutes on low flame, further add the boiled potatoes, green peas, salt & pepper to taste, chaat masala, kasuri methi and freshly chopped coriander leaves, stir well to mix the potatoes and the masala well.
Increase the flame to medium high & cook the potatoes for 6-7 minutes, it should get some colour while cooking, mash the potatoes lightly while keeping a few chunks intact. Further transfer the mixture in a bowl and allow it to cool down to room temperature. As the filling is ready, you can make the samosa.
For making samosa, make the samosa sheets, for that, knead the dough once again that has been resting & divide in equal size dough balls, further flatten the dough balls in thin sheets, making an oval shape, make sure the sheet is not too thin or too thick, divide the sheet width wise in two equal halves. Roll the sheet once again after cutting, as the sheet may shrink a little bit. 
Pick one sheet & apply water on the edge of the straight line, bring the ends together and seal well to shape like a cone, fill sufficient amount of aloo filling, while lightly pressing downwards, bring the openings of the samosa together and seal properly to shape a proper samosa. Shape all the samosa in the same way, make sure to cover with a cloth while you’re shaping other samosa. By the time you can set oil for deep frying.
For frying, set oil in a big kadhai for deep frying, make sure the kadhai should be wide enough, heat the oil on medium heat and drop in the samosa, fry the samosa on medium heat until they are crisp and golden brown in colour, make sure to fry the samosa in batches but in good quantity that the kadhai is filled but do not overcrowd, make sure the oil should not be too hot, fry the samosa on low to medium flame the samosas are perfectly cooked from inside, adjust the flame accordingly, if you have a thermometer, fry the samosa at 140 ℃ - 150 ℃.
To make them in an air fryer, preheat the air fryer for 5-10 minutes over 180 C, then place the shaped samosa in the air fryer & brush them with ghee, air fry them for 20-25 minutes until crips & golden brown, you can turn the samosas around after a while so that they cook evenly.
Your crispy hot samosas are ready, you can serve as it is with the chutneys of your choice, salted fried green chillies & a cup of chai.

To cook the thalipeeth, set a tawa over high flame & let it get hot until you shape the thalipeeth.
You will require a flat platform & a muslin cloth to shape the thalipeeth.
Dip the cloth into water & squeeze out all the extra water, then plate the cloth on the platform.
Take a medium sized portion from the dough, form it into a roundel & then slightly press it to get an evenly sized thick disc.

Lift the muslin cloth from one side & place it upside down on the tawa so that the thalipeeth sticks, then carefully peel off the muslin cloth from the top.
Add ghee in the holes & on the sides, then separate the thalipeeth from the tawa using a flat spatula, cover & cook over medium low flame for 2-3 minutes.
Further take the lid off, slip the thalipeeth & pour ghee in the holes & on the sides & cook for 2-3 minutes.
Your delicious & healthy thalipeeth is ready, serve hot along with some curd, pickle & white butter.

Method:
To make crispy chicken you will need to cut the chicken correctly, slice the chicken breast in half so that you get 2 evenly thin pieces, then cut the chicken into thin strips against the grain, cut the remaining chicken similarly & transfer it into a bowl.
Further add salt, white pepper powder, ginger garlic paste, vinegar & light soy sauce, mix well & marinate the chicken.
To make the batter add corn flour, refined flour, salt, white pepper & baking powder into a bowl & mix all the dry ingredients until they get combined.
Further add egg white & water, whisk it continuously to make a semi thin smoothly flowing slurry, your batter is ready.
Add the marinated chicken into the batter & mix well to coat all the chicken pieces with the batter, then carefully drop the chicken pieces into moderately hot (175 C) oil & fry them until slightly light golden brown, this will only take 2-3 minutes.
Once fried transfer the chicken into a sieve, make sure you fry the chicken in batches, don’t over-crowd the pan.
Your first fried chicken is ready, we will flash fry it & then add it into the sauce for extra crispiness.
Deseed & soak the kashmiri red chillies in hot water for 1-2 hours then add them into a mixer grinder jar with a splash of water & grind them into a fine paste, your red chilli paste is ready.
Set a pan over high flame & once it gets hot, add the oil & let the oil heat up as well.
Further add the red chilli paste, stir well & cook over medium high flame until the paste turns crumbly/coarse in texture & all the oil is released, this process will take 4-5 minutes.
Once cooked, add vinegar & stir well, your cooked chilli paste is ready, transfer it into a bowl & cool it down, you can also store it in an airtight container, if you only want to make red chilli paste for one portion then follow the same process using 3-5 kashmiri red chillies. You can also skip this process & directly replace the cooked chilli paste with schezwan sauce further in the recipe.
Before making the sauce, reheat the frying oil until it gets slightly more hot than moderately hot which is around 185 C
To make the sauce set a wok over high heat, once the wok gets hot, add the oil & let it heat up as well.
Further add garlic, ginger, green chillies & saute them over high flame for 30 seconds.
Then add capsicum, spring onion bulbs, cooked red chilli paste, ketchup, red chilli sauce, light soy sauce & vinegar, stir well & then add salt, white pepper powder & hot water, stir well again & bring the sauce to a simmer.
To thicken the sauce, add corn flour & water in a separate bowl, whisk well to make a slurry, then add the slurry into the sauce while stirring it continuously, lower the flame once the sauce thickens, your sauce is ready.
Add the first fried chicken into the oil carefully & flash fry it for a minute to minute & half until it turns crisp & golden brown.
Once fried remove the chicken from the oil using a large spider & let the excess oil drip off, then add the chicken into the wok followed by spring onion greens, stir well & coat the chicken with the sauce, make sure you don’t cook it a lot at this stage.
Your restaurant style crispy chicken is ready.

Birista
Ingredients:
ONION | प्याज़ 500 GRAMS (SLICED)
Method:
To make birista you need to cut the onions in a specific way, so firstly peel the onion & cut them in half & now you need to cut the onions length wise, make sure that the slices are neither too thin nor too thick & the slices are evenly cut.
Once you have cut all the onions you need to separate all the layers.
Now to fry the onions, heat oil in a deep pan till it gets moderately hot, if you have a thermometer then the temperature of the oil should be 135 C.
The quantity of the oil should not be too much, the oil should only come up till the surface of the onions.
Once the oil is hot, transfer the onions & fry the onions on high flame while continuously stirring them, the onions will start releasing their moisture & the temperature of the oil will tend to drop which is why you’ll need to fry them on high flame.
If the oil is extremely hot in the beginning the onions will fry quickly from the outside but won’t lose their internal moisture & they will turn out to be limp & not crispy.
After frying them for 15-20 minutes & once they get slightly light golden brown, you’ll need to be very attentive, remove the onions from the hot oil using a spider at this very stage, you can use a ladle to scoop out the onions from the oil & then transfer them onto the spider.
Transfer the fried onions on a tissue lined tray or plate & spread them using two forks so that they cool down quickly, dab them from the top using a tissue paper to get rid of any excess oil, reserve the oil to use in the marinade & in the further cooking process.
Let the birista cool down for 5-6 minutes, your perfectly coloured & crispy birista is ready. 
We will use 80% of the birista for the marinade & the remaining 20% will be used while layering the biryani & as garnish.
Make sure that you reserve a few tablespoons of the oil that you fried the barista in, it will be required in the further cooking processes.

Sheer Khurma Recipe | Eid Special Recipe | शीर खुरमा बनाने का तरीका | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Sheer Khurma
Prep time: 15-20 minutes (excluding soaking time)
Cooking time: 45-50 minutes
Serves: 6-8 people

Ingredients:
DRY DATES | छुआरे 6-7 NOS. 
CASHEW | काजू 15-18 NOS. 
PISTACHIO | पिस्ता 15-18 NOS.
CHIRONJI | चिरोंजी 1.5 TBSP
ALMOND | बादाम 15-18 NOS.
RAISIN | किशमिश 1 TBSP
WHOLE WHEAT VERMICELLI | सेवई 30 GRAMS
MILK | दूध 2 LITRES (FULL FAT)
GHEE | घी AS REQUIRED
SAFFRON | केसर A FEW STRANDS (OPTIONAL)
SUGAR | शक्कर 120 GRAMS
GREEN CARDAMOM POWDER | हरी इलायची का पाउडर 1/2 TSP
Method:
Soak the dry dates, cashew, pistachio, chironji & almonds overnight.
Once soaked peel the almonds & pistachios, cut them into slivers along with cashews.
Rub the chironji in the water so that the skin comes off, then spread them on a plate & let them dry for a few minutes, you can also microwave them for 30 seconds, once dried gently blow air to get rid of the peels.
Transfer all the nuts into a bowl & keep them aside.
Further deseed the soaked dry dates & chop them, transfer them into a separate bowl.
Lastly crush the vermicelli in a bowl & keep it aside, this is all the pre-prep that you need to do.
To make sheer khurma, take a heavy bottomed stock pot & set it over the stove & add all the milk into it, then switch on the flame to high & bring the milk to a boil, once the milk comes to a boil, set it aside on a separate burner & let it simmer over medium to low flame until you roast the nuts, dry fruits & vermicelli.
Set a pan over high heat & once it gets hot add in 2 tablespoons of ghee & heat up the ghee as well.
Add all the chopped nuts & roast them for 3-4 minutes over low flame, you don’t have to fry them until golden brown, then transfer them into a bowl.
Add the same residual ghee from the bowl into the pan & add the chopped dry dates & raisins & roast similarly & transfer them into a bowl.
Set the same pan back on the heat & add 1-2 teaspoons ghee & add the vermicelli, roast the vermicelli until golden brown, roast the vermicelli very carefully as it tends to burn very easily.
Once roasted, add the vermicelli into the simmering milk along with dry dates, raisins, nuts & saffron strands, make sure to reserve some roasted nuts for garnish.
Stir everything well & increase the flame to medium, you have to cook the sheer khurma until it reduces to 2/3rd of the original quantity while stirring it frequently, this process will take upto 30-35 minutes.
After cooking it for 10-12 minutes, add in the sugar & cardamom powder, stir well & continue to cook it further for 15 minutes.
After cooking it for 30-35 minutes, you’ll see that the quantity will have reduced.
Your sheer khurma is ready at this stage, you can cook it even further if you want to serve it hot, but I like to serve it chilled.
Switch off the flame at this stage & cool down the sheer khurma, once it comes to room temperature, place it in the fridge, it will thicken up after it cools down completely.
Your sheer khurma is ready, garnish with roasted nuts & serve.

OIL | तेल 2 TSP
GHEE | घी AS REQUIRED (MELTED)

WATER | पानी
Method:
To make the dough, add the flour and salt in a mixing bowl, mix and add water gradually as required to knead a semi soft dough, once all the dry flour combines transfer the dough onto the kitchen platform & knead it until smooth & soft.
Further add add oil and knead until the oil gets incorporated, then form it into a doughball, place it in a bowl & drizzle some oil & cover it with a damp cloth, let the dough rest for at least 1 hour.
Once the dough is rested, divide in equal size dough balls & place them on a tray or a plate, cover them with a damp cloth while you are shaping the parathas.
Shaping Method 1 
Take a dough & coat it with dry flour, place it on a platform & roll it out into a thin chapati using a rolling pin, then spread some melted ghee on the chapati & dust dry wheat flour, then roll the thin chapati from one end to the other to make a long rolled cylinder, then again roll the rolled strip from one end to the other & tuck the last bit under.
Shaping Method 2
Coat the doughball with dry flour & roll it out into a thin chapati, try to make this one as circular as possible, then apply melted ghee & dust dry flour on it.
Then make a single slit from the centre of the chapati to the edge, then lift the roll the slit end to make a cone.
Once you have formed the cone, flatten it out to make a layered doughball.
Shaping method 3 
Take the dough ball & roll into thin chapati, evenly spread melted ghee over the chapati & dust dry flour over the chapati, fold the chapati while making the pleats, roll the dough and tuck inwards to seal properly & form a layered doughball.

Add the minced meat into a large bowl followed by salt, turmeric powder & all the remaining ingredients of the marinade & mix well with the mutton, set the mutton aside & let it marinate until you cook the base masala, you can also marinate the mutton overnight or for a couple of hours.
To make the masala set a pan over high heat, add oil & once the oil gets hot add in the cumin seeds along with the chopped onions, stir well & cook until the onions turn golden brown.
Once the onions turn light golden brown add in the ginger garlic chilli paste, stir & continue to cook until the onions turn golden brown.
Then lower the flame & add all the powdered spices, stir & immediately add a splash of hot water then stir & cook over high flame until the oil gets separated, this process will take 3-4 minutes.
Further add the chopped tomatoes, coriander stems & salt, stir well & cook over high flame for 10-12 minutes until the tomatoes get cooked & the oil separates again, your base masala for mutton keema is ready.
Now to cook the mutton keema set a pressure cooker over high heat & add in the oil, ghee & let it get hot.
Further add in all the whole spices along with green chilli & the marinated mutton keema, stir well & cook over high flame for 5-6 minutes until the meats releases its moisture.
Then add the cooked base masala & mix it well with the keema, then put the lid on & cook the mutton for 1 whistle over high flame & then for 2-3 more whistles over low flame.
Once cooked switch off the flame & let the cooker de-pressurize naturally then open the lid & stir the mutton well, if the keema hasn’t cooked then you can cook for 1-2 more whistles.
Switch on the flame to high & add in the garam masala, black pepper powder, roasted kasuri methi powder, green chilli, fresh coriander & ghee, stir well & cook for the final 2-3 minutes.
Your Punjabi style mutton keema is ready, serve it hot along with toasted pav (skewered over direct flame) or with butter pav.

Once the dough becomes smooth & soft, form it into a doughball & transfer it into a greased bowl & add oil to brush the surface of the dough & cover it with a moist cloth, let the dough rest for 2 hours at least.
To toast the whole spices set a pan over high heat & lower the flame once it gets hot, add all the whole spices & dry roast them over low flame until fragrant.

Paneer Tikka Masala - https://youtu.be/fohA4X5pYSg 

Prep time: 10 minutes (excluding dough resting time)
Cooking time: 1-2 minutes (for one roti)
Serves: 6-7  roti (depending on the roti size)

Ingredients:
Dough
REFINED FLOUR | मैदा 1.5 CUPS
WHEAT FLOUR | गेहूं का आटा 1/2 CUP
SALT | नमक TO TASTE
SUGAR | शक्कर 1 TSP
OIL | तेल 1 TBSP
MILK | दूध 1 CUP (LUKEWARM)
REFINED FLOUR | मैदा AS REQUIRED
OIL | तेल 
Salt water
SALT | नमक 2-3 TBSP
WATER | पानी 1 CUP
Method:
In a mixing bowl, add all the ingredients, except milk and mix well, now add milk in batches and combine well, once it becomes like a dough, transfer over the table top, sprinkle some refined flour if the dough is too sticky and knead well for 10-12 minutes using the stretch & fold method.
Once the dough becomes smooth & soft, form it into a doughball & place it in a greased bowl, drizzle oil over the surface of the dough, cover it with & damp cloth & let it rest for 2 hours at least.
Prepare salt water by just simply mixing salt & water in a bowl.
Set a tawa over high heat & let it get extremely hot, make sure you use iron tawa or roti tawa, do not use a non-stick pan.
Sprinkle salt water over the tawa once is hot, the water will evaporate instantly leaving behind a coating of salt which will make the tawa nonstick.
To make the rumali roti take a portion from the rested dough & form it into a roundel, coat the roundel with refined flour & roll it out into an extremely thin roti, keep dusting refined flour during the process.
Place the roti on the hot tawa, rumali roti inly takes a few seconds to cook from each side so flip it after 10-15 seconds.
Cook the rumali roti from both the sides until tiny brown spots appear on the surface, once cooked, remove the roti from the tawa.
Your super soft & thin rumali roti is ready, you can serve them with any kebabs or curries.

Eggless Burger Buns Recipe | बिना अंडे के बर्गर बंस | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe Eggless Burger Buns

Prep time: 5-10 minutes
Cooking time: 2.5 hours
Serves: 7 burger buns

Ingredients:
WATER | पानी 150 ML (LUKEWARM)
SUGAR | शक्कर 1/2 TSP
INSTANT YEAST | इंस्टेंट यीस्ट 6 GRAMS / 1/2 TBSP
POTATO | आलू 1 NO. MEDIUM SIZE / 80-85 GRAMS (BOILED)
REFINED FLOUR | मैदा 320 GRAMS
SALT | नमक 1 TSP
UNSALTED BUTTER | अनसाल्टेड बटर 25 GRAMS (SOFT)
OIL | तेल AS REQUIRED
MILK | दूध AS REQUIRED
BUTTER | मक्खन AS REQUIRED
Method:
In a bowl add water & sugar, stir well to dissolve the sugar then add in the yeast & dissolve it as well, further cover the bowl with cling wrap of a plate & set it aside for 5-10 minutes.
The mixture should froth up after the rest, this will indicate that the yeast is alive, if the mixture doesn’t froth up repeat the process with new yeast.
Further take a boiled medium sized potato into a large bowl & mash it completely using a spatula until it becomes smooth. 
Add the refined flour & salt in the same bowl as the potato & mix the flour well with the potato.
Further add the yeast & water mixture into the flour & combine it well using your hands to form the dough.
Once all the dry flour gets incorporated, transfer the dough onto a flat surface & knead it for 3-4 minutes.
Then add the soft unsalted butter in 2 batches & incorporate it into the dough, once you have added all the butter knead the dough really well for 10-12 minutes until it becomes super soft & smooth, to check if your dough is ready take a small portion of the dough & stretch it, it should form an extremely thin sheet which is almost transparent, this is called a gluten window.
Once a gluten window forms your dough is ready, form it into a large doughball & transfer it into a large, greased bowl & drizzle a few drops of oil over the surface of the dough, cover the bowl with cling wrap & place it in a warm corner of the kitchen & let the dough ferment until its double the size, it will take 1-1.5 hours approximately depending upon the room temperature.
After the dough becomes double in size, remove the cling & puncture the dough using your hand & then transfer it onto a flat surface & divide it into 80 grams portions, you should get about 7 portions.
Cover the portions using a damp cloth until you roll the other doughballs, to shape the doughball pull & bring the edges of the dough portion towards the centre then flip it & roll it into a tight & smooth doughball.
Shape all the doughballs similarly & place them on a butter paper lined baking tray & gently press all the doughballs with your hand to flatten them out.
Further cover it with a damp cloth & let it rest for 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes you’ll see that the doughballs have risen slightly, at this stage brush the surface of the doughballs using milk & place it into a 190C preheated oven & bake for 12-14 minutes or until their surface becomes light golden brown.
Once the buns are baked remove the tray from the oven & brush them with melted butter immediately.
Further transfer them from the tray onto a cooling rack & cool them down completely.
Your freshly baked eggless & fluffy burger buns are ready.

Further take the potatoes out from the cooker & peel them once cooled, then poke holes into the potatoes using a fork or a toothpick, this will help them to fry properly.
To fry the potatoes set a kadhai over the flame & add ample amount of mustard oil in it, the oil should be enough to partially cover the potatoes when you add them.
Switch on the flame to high & heat the oil until it reaches its smoking point then lower the flame & allow the oil to cool down slightly.
Further add the potatoes & fry them without stirring initially so that they start turning slightly golden from the bottom, then stir & fry them over medium high flame until they turn golden & crispy from all sides.
Once fried, transfer the potatoes into a sieve & let them cool down, poke the potatoes again using a toothpick or a fork, this will help the spices & gravy to seep into the potatoes so that they become flavorful from the inside, your fried potatoes for dum aloo are ready.
In a mortar add the black cardamom, green cardamom & cinnamon stick & pound them very slightly so that the cardamom pods break open & the cinnamon stick breaks.
Further take some oil out from the kadhai to make the gravy & heat the oil in the kadhai.
Add the cumin seeds, bay leaf, cloves & the crushed spices, mix the kashmiri red chilli powder & hot water in a separate bowl & add the paste, stir well & cook the spices & the kashmiri red chilli powder for 1-2 minutes over low flame.
Further add asafoetida, fennel seed powder & ginger powder, stir well & cook for 3 minutes over medium flame.

Once the chocolate melts remove it from the heat, get the tray from the fridge & pour the melted chocolate over the granola, spread it out evenly using a spatula.
Place it back in the fridge & let it set for 4-5 hours or overnight.
Once set demold it, remove the butter paper & cut it into bars according to your preference.

Method:
Transfer the cleaned & sorted surti papdi in a large bowl along with its beans & tur peas, cover them in hot water & add a pinch of baking soda, stir well & let them soak until you continue with the further process, soaking them will reduces their cooking time.
To make muthiyas add the chopped fenugreek in a large bowl & then add, gram flour, wheat flour, oil & all the remaining ingredients.
Mix the mixture well with your hands & then gradually add splashes of water to combine all the ingredients, make sure you don’t add too much of water.
Once the mixture comes together & forms a semi stiff dough, apply oil on your hands, take a small portion of the dough & form it into a roundel, shape all the remaining mixture similarly.
To fry the muthiyas heat oil in a deep pan to 160C or until it gets moderately hot, further add the shaped muthiyas into the hot oil & fry them over medium high flame until crisp & golden brown.
Transfer them into a sieve once fried so that all the excess oil drips off & your methi muthiyas for undhiyu are ready.
In the same oil add the diced potato & sweet potato, fry them over medium flame until slightly light golden brown then transfer them into a sieve.
Further fry the purple yam similarly & transfer it into a sieve as well, your fried veggies are ready.
To make the green masala add green garlic, fresh coriander, peanuts, sesame seeds & green chilli into a chopper & grind it into a coarse mixture, transfer the mixture into a bowl & add the remaining ingredients of the green masala & mix well, your green masala is ready.
Stuff the slit brinjals with the prepared green masala & coat the fried veggies with the green masala too.
Set a large kadhai over high heat & add the oil, once the oil gets hot add the carom seeds then drain the water from the soaked papdi & add it into the oil along with a pinch of salt, stir well then cover & cook until the papdi is 70% cooked.
Once the papdi is cooked add in the stuffed brinjals, stir well & cook them similarly until they turn semi-soft, make sure you don’t cook them all the way through.

When all the milk reduces, add the sugar & green cardamom powder, stir well & cook the halwa over medium heat while stirring it continuously until the natural ghee is released from the halwa, this process will take 15-20 minutes.
Switch off the flame once the ghee is released then heat a pan & add the ghee into it, further add the almonds & cashews once the ghee gets hot & fry them until they turn light golden brown.
Further pour the ghee(optional) & nuts over the halwa along with raisins & stir well.
Your gajrela is ready.

ONION | प्याज़ 3 MEDIUM SIZED. (SLICED)
CORIANDER SEEDS | धनिया 1 TBSP
BLACK PEPPERCORNS | साबुत काली मिर्च 1 TSP

MALVANI MASALA | मालवणी मसाला 4-5 TBSP
HOT WATER | गरम पानी AS REQUIRED 
SALT | नमक TO TATSE
FRESH CORIANDER | हरा धनिया A LARGE HANDFUL 
Method:
Add the fresh coriander, green chilli, ginger, garlic & water into a mixer grinder jar & grind into a fine paste, make sure you add very little water. Your green vaatan is ready.
Add the chicken into a large bowl, I’m using desi chicken today you can use broiler chicken too, further add all the ingredients of the marinade & mix it well with the chicken, set it aside to marinate until you do the further process.
To make the wet vaatan set a kadhai over high flame & add oil, once the oil gets hot add the onions & cook them over high flame briefly & then add coriander seeds, black peppercorns, cloves & cinnamon, stir & cook until the onions turn translucent.
Once the onions turn translucent, add garlic, ginger & coconut, stir well & cook until the coconuts turns slightly golden brown, then transfer the onion & coconut into a bowl & cool them down completely.
Then transfer it into a mixer grinder jar & grind it into a fine paste using very little water, your wet vaatan is ready.
I’m cooking the chicken curry over a chulha today, you can follow the same steps & cook the curry over a stove.
Set the handi over the flame & add the oil, once the oil heats up, add in the onions & cook them until they turn light golden brown.
Once the onions turn light golden brown, add kashmiri red chilli powder, malvani masala & a splash of hot water, stir & cook the spices for 2-3 minutes (make sure you lower the flame before adding the spices).
Further add the wet vaatan you prepared earlier & stir well, cook the vaatan while stirring frequently until the oil separates, if the masala becomes too dry while cooking it then add hot water as required & continue to cook the masala.
Once you have cooked the masala, add in the marinated chicken along with salt to taste, stir well & cook the chicken over high flame then add hot water & stir well, further partially cover the vessel with a lid & cook until the chicken is done.
Since I have used desi chicken, it will take about 45 minutes to an hour to cook fully, if you are using broiler chicken then it should cook in about 20-25 minutes.
Remove the lid after long intervals & stir the chicken, is you want the curry to be thickn then add less water initially & if you want it to be thinner then add more water.
Once the chicken is cooked & the oil comes floating on the top, taste & adjust the seasoning accordingly then add freshly chopped coriander & stir well.
Your malvani chicken curry is ready, serve it hot with bhakris & rice.

You can also dry the chillies in an oven at 100 C for 25 minutes, I always dry the chillies in the oven.
Once the chillies become dry & crisp, break the stalk off the chillies & transfer them into a mixer grinder & grind it into a fine powder.
Transfer the chilli powder into a large bowl.
To toast the whole spices set a kadhai over high flame & heat it really well, once the kadhai gets hot lower the flame & add coriander seeds, cumin seeds, caraway seeds, fennel seeds, mustard seeds & poppy seeds, mix well & dry roast the spices until they become fragrant.
Once the spices get fragrant transfer the spices into a bowl & set the kadhai back over the flame.
Further add all the remaining whole spices in the kadhai & dry roast them while stirring them frequently until they become fragrant, then transfer the spices into the same bowl & cool them down completely.
Transfer all the spices into a mixer grinder jar & grind them into a fine powder, then transfer it into a bowl.
Further mix the garam masala & the chilli powder together then strain them into a large plate using a sieve.
Your malvani masala is ready, transfer it into an airtight jar (preferably a glass jar), you can use the masala for upto a year if stored correctly.

Place a steel bowl over the dal in the cooker & add the peanuts into the bowl, put the cooker’s lid on & cook the dal over medium high flame for 2-3 whistles, then switch off the flame & let the cooker de-pressurize.
Once de-pressurized open the lid, remove the peanuts & set them aside, then blend the dal using a blender, your boiled toor dal is ready.
Now to temper the dal set a deep pan or a stock pot over high flame & once it gets hot add in the ghee & let the ghee heat as well.
Once the ghee gets hot add the cumin seeds, mustard seeds, cloves, cinnamon, red chillies, fenugreek seeds, asafoetida, curry leaves, tomato, ginger chilli paste & salt to taste, stir & cook over high flame until the tomatoes get slightly mushy.
Further add turmeric powder & kashmiri red chilli powder, stir quickly & add the boiled dal, stir well & add hot water to adjust the consistency of the dal, make sure to keep the dal a little watery at this stage as its going to simmer for a while you will be making the dhoklis.
Add the boiled peanuts, jaggery & tamarind pulp, stir well & set the flame to medium low, let the dal simmer until you prepare the dhoklis.

Method:
In a large bowl add all the dry ingredients along with the oil & mix everything well.
Further add water as required to make a semi-soft dough, the dough should be of the same stiffness as a puri/chapati dough.
Once you have kneaded the dough, cover it with a damp cloth for 10-15 minutes.
Divide the dough into 2 portions once rested, coat one portion with dry flour & roll it into a large chapati, it shouldn’t be too thick or too thin.
Further cut the chapati into squares, diamonds or strips using a pizza cutter or a knife, I have cut them into diamonds.
Cut the second portion similarly & your dhoklis will be ready to be added into the dal.
Final cooking

Method:
Check the dal that has been simmering, taste & adjust accordingly, I added a tablespoon of both tamarind pulp & jaggery, stir well & bring the dal to a boil before adding the dhoklis or else the dhoklis will stick to each other when you add them in the dal.
Once the dal comes to a boil, add the all the cut dhoklis carefully & then gently stir them into the dal.
Cover the pan with a lid & cook over medium low flame for 10 minutes.
Once cooked, remove the lid, you will see that the dal has thickened up a bit & the dhoklis will have fluffed up.
Add some freshly chopped coriander & stir well.
Your dal dhokli is ready, add ghee & lemon juice over the dal while serving along with crispy papads.

Further add the refined flour, wheat flour & rest of the dry ingredients & mix using a spatula until all the dry flour combines.
Then transfer the dough onto a kitchen platform & knead the dough for 8-10 minutes or until it becomes smooth & less non-sticky.
Once the dough becomes smooth & non-sticky form it into a tight round dough ball & place it in a greased bowl & drizzle a few drops of oil over the surface of the dough to prevent it from getting dry, cover the bowl with clingwrap or a wet cloth & let the dough rest for at least 2 hours, you can let the dough for a few more hours if you have the time.
Transfer the dough onto a kitchen platform & divide it into equal sized roundels, I have divided them into 75-80 grams portions.
Place the shaped roundels onto an oiled baking tray or a plate & again drizzle a few drops of oil on the doughballs to prevent them from getting dry.
Cover the doughballs using a damp cloth & let them rest for 15-20 minutes,
After the final rest the doughballs will be ready to be cooked.
To cook the naan, you will require a tawa that is “not” non-stick.
Heat the tawa really well before you start shaping the naans.
To check if the tawa is ready, sprinkle water on the tawa, if the water evaporates instantly then the tawa is ready.

Then grab & pull one side of the naan to form it into an oval shape, you can keep the naan round as well.
Lift the naan & apply water on the back side of it, make sure you apply it nicely or else the naan won’t stick to the tawa properly.
Then place the naan, water side down, on the hot tawa & press it down carefully using your fingers to stick it onto the tawa.
Cook it for 10-15 seconds over high flame or until bubbles start appearing on the surface.
Further lift the tawa, flip & hold it over direct flame & cook until the naan becomes light golden brown & crisp from the top, make sure you keep rotating the tawa over the flame so that the naan cooks evenly.

Add the rice & dal into a large bowl & wash them with water until it runs clear, further add the fenugreek seeds into the same bowl, soak the dal & rice for 4-5 hours.
Once the dal & rice have soaked, add the poha into a small sieve or a bowl, wash them & transfer them into the same bowl as the dal & rice, let the poha soak for 5-10 minutes.
Further discard the water & add all the soaked ingredients into a mixer grinder jar along with sour curd & water, grind everything into a semi fine paste, once grinded the batter should feel like fine semolina when you press & feel it between your fingers.
Transfer the batter into a cooker or a stock pot & add asafoetida & sugar, whisk the batter well using a whisk for 1-2 minutes.
Cover the cooker or the stock pot with a lid & keep it in a warm place to ferment, the duration of the fermentation will depend upon the room temperature & the weather, if the weather is cold then the batter will take at least 12-15 hours or more to ferment properly if kept in a warm place. During summers the batter will ferment within 8-10 hours.
Once fermented the batter will puff up, at this stage set the dhokla steamer over high flame & bring the water to a boil, once the water comes to a boil & the steamer is ready, you can continue to season the batter with the further process.
Add the ginger chilli paste, oil, baking soda & salt into the batter & mix everything well very gently.
Brush the dhokla steaming plates with oil & pour the batter into the plates according to your preference of thickness.
Move the plates around to spread the batter evenly on the plate & then tap them gently on the kitchen platform.
Sprinkle some freshly crushed black peppercorns & place them into the steamer, cover & steam the dhoklas over high flame for 10-12 minutes. The steaming time will depend on the thickness of the batter you have poured, if you are making thin dhoklas then they will steam within 8-10 minutes & if you are making thick dhoklas then they will take upto 12-15 minutes.
To check if they are done, open the lid & touch the surface of the dhokla, if it’s not sticky & a knife inserted comes out clean then the dhoklas are ready.
Remove them from the steamer & immediately brush the surface with oil & let them cool down slightly before cutting them.
Further cut the dhoklas into squares or diamonds & remove them from the steaming plate using a flat spatula.
Your super soft & spongy white dhoklas are ready, serve them hot with some chutney.

Mutton Dum Biryani Recipe | स्वादिष्ट मटन दम बिरयानी | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Mutton Dum Biryani

Prep time: 35-40 minutes
Cooking time: 1.5 hours (excluding marination time)
Serves: 7-8 people

Birista
Ingredients:
ONION | प्याज़ 750 GRAMS
Method:
To make birista you need to cut the onions in a specific way, so firstly peel the onions & cut them in half & now you need to cut the onions length wise, make sure that the slices are neither too thin nor too thick & the slices are evenly cut.
Once you have cut all the onions you need to separate all the layers.
Now to fry the onions, heat oil in a kadhai till it gets moderately hot, if you have a thermometer then the temperature of the oil should be 135 C.
The quantity of the oil should not be too much, the oil should only come up till the surface of the onions.
Once the oil is hot, transfer the onions & fry the onions on high flame while continuously stirring them, the onions will start releasing their moisture & the temperature of the oil will tend to drop which is why you’ll need to fry them on high flame.
If the oil is extremely hot in the beginning the onions will fry quickly from the outside but won’t lose their internal moisture & they will turn out to be limp & not crispy.
After frying them for 15-20 minutes & once they get slightly light golden brown, you’ll need to be very attentive, remove the onions from the hot oil using a spider at this very stage, you can use a ladle to scoop out the onions from the oil & then transfer them onto the spider.
Transfer the fried onions on a tissue lined tray or plate & spread them using two forks so that they cool down quickly, dab them from the top using a tissue paper to get rid of any excess oil, reserve a few tablespoons of this oil to use in the marinade.
Let the birista cool down for 5-6 minutes, your perfectly coloured & crispy birista is ready. 
We will use 80% of the birista for the marinade & the remaining 20% will be used while layering the biryani & as garnish.

In a large bowl add the poha, make sure that the poha that you are using are of the thick variety & they should be old.
Add water into the bowl & gently wash the poha by mixing them in the water, then immediately strain the poha using a sieve, let the poha rest in the sieve for 8-10 minutes.

Set a pan over high flame, once the pan gets hot, add the oil & heat it well.
Further add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, green chill, curry leaves & peanuts, mix well & cook over low flame briefly & then add the potatoes.
Cook the potatoes over high flame until they are half cooked, make sure you half cook the potatoes before adding the onions, if you add potatoes & onion together then the onions will get overcooked.
Once the potatoes are half done, add in the chopped onion & sugar, stir well & cook until the onion turns almost light golden brown over high flame.
When the onion turns almost light golden brown the potatoes will also be cooked perfectly, lower the flame at this stage & add salt & turmeric powder, mix well & add the soaked poha along with fresh coriander & lemon juice, stir everything very gently.
Further add a splash of water over the poha & cover the pan with a lid, switch off the flame & let the poha rest for 3-4 minutes, following this step will ensure that the poha turns out to be very moist & fluffy due to the steam.
Remove the lid after 3-4 minutes & sprinkle some freshly chopped coriander.
Your batata poha is ready, garnish with some grated coconut while serving.

How to make Sabudana Vada | Chef Sanjyot Keer #shorts,"Crisp & super tasty

Save this and do give it a try!! 🥰

To make the mixture of sabudana vada, in a bowl add

CRUSHED PEANUTS 3/4 CUP
CUMIN SEEDS 1 TSP

CURRY LEAVES 8-10 NOS. (CHOPPED)

Start mixing all the ingredients together lightly with your hands, once everything is well combined start mashing the mixture, make sure you are being gentle, you just have to mash it lightly to bind everything, applying excess pressure will crush the sabudana & it will ruin the texture of you vadas.

To check if your mixture is ready, take spoonful of mixture in your hand & try to make a roundel, if the roundel holds its shape nicely then your mixture is ready.

For shaping the vadas, apply a very little amount of water on your hands, take a spoonful of mixture & make a roundel of it by pressing it in your fist & rotating it.

Once you have formed a roundel, flatten it into a patty shape by patting it in between your palms & applying pressure, shape all the vadas in the same way.

To fry the vadas heat oil in kadhai or a deep pan, the oil should be moderately hot or around 175 C, carefully drop the vadas in hot oil & don’t stir for the initial minute or else the vadas might break or stick to the spider.

Fry the vadas on medium flame until crisp & golden brown, remove them using a spider & place them in a sieve so that all the excess oil drips off.

Your crispy hot sabudana vadas are ready.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMyMYf0aLyM

Easy Ghevar Recipe | Diwali Special | घेवर बनाने का आसान तरीक़ा | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Ghevar 

Prep time: 10-15 minutes
Cooking time: 45-50 minutes
Serves: 9-10 ghevars (depending on shape and size)

Ghevar
Ingredients:
Ghee | घी 1/4 cup
Ice cubes | बर्फ 2 nos.
Refined flour | मैदा 1 cup
Gram flour | बेसन 1 tbsp
Chilled water | ठंडा पानी 2.5 cups
Lemon juice | नींबू का रस 1 tsp
Oil / ghee for frying
Method:
Set a pan on medium heat, add ghee and just melt it, do not heat it a lot.
Further, in a mixer grinder, add the melted ghee and few ice cubes, grind it well until the ghee gets frozen, scrap off the frozen ghee on the grinder jar wall, make sure if there is any water in the jar make sure to drain it off, there should be no water.
Once frozen add refined flour and besan in batches and combine the ghee and flour together, the texture should be crumbly and not at all like a dough.
Once it becomes crumbly, add chilled water in batches and grind well, to make a smooth flowy batter. The temperature of the batter should be chilled throughout the grinding & combining process.
Once a smooth and flowy batter is made transfer it in a squeezy bottle, keep the batter refrigerated until you fry them for making ghevar.
For making ghevar, set oil / ghee in a flat bottom vessel, here i'm using almost 5-inch round ring that is almost 2 inch in height, you can use any shape or size cutter or ring, you have to put the ring in the oil and the oil has to be almost 1 cm lower to the rim of the ring.
Once the oil is heated well, pour in the chilled batter in batches, as soon as you pour little batter there will be bubbles formed, and so it is necessary to keep the batter chilled, as when the cold batter is fried in hot oil the formation of bubbles makes those mesh pattern to make ghevar. Once you pour the batter little by little in batches for at least 6-7 times, a layer will be formed carefully make a hole in the centre using a rolling pin, once the hole is formed, pour the batter again in batches in the centre for at least 10-12 times more, in total you have to pour 18-20 times, more the batter you pour thicker the ghevar will be. You can make these ghevar in advance and keep it in an airtight container for couple of days.
To ensure that the batter is chilled throughout the frying process you can dip the bottle in ice cold water.
Your ghevars are ready, serve by dipping it or pouring some sugar syrup and topping it with lacche wali rabdi and some nuts of your choice.


Lacche wali rabadi
Ingredients:

Jalebi Recipe | Crispy Jalebi | Dusshera Special | हलवाई जैसी जलेबी | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Jalebi

Prep time: 10-15 minutes (excluding fermentation time)
Cooking time: 20-25 minutes
Serves: 6-8 people
Batter
Ingredients:
SOUR CURD | खट्टा दही 100 GRAMS
WATER | पानी 80 ML
REFINED FLOUR | मैदा 500 GRAMS 
WATER | पानी 325-350 ML 
WATER | पानी 8 TBSP
Method:
Take a deep stock pot or a vessel & add the sour curd & 1/3rd cup of water into it, now using your hands or a whisk mix the water & curd to make buttermilk.
Further add the refined flour into the vessel & combine well.
Once combined, add the remaining water in two batches & mix really well while continuously whisking it, no big clumps of refined flour should remain in the batter.
The amount of water required will depend upon the moisture that will be present in the curd that you will be using so adjust 10-15 ml of water accordingly.
Once you have whisked the batter & it forms into a semi-smooth batter, wipe the edges of the vessel then splash water on the surface of the batter & smoothen it out completely.
 Now cover the vessel with a lid & keep it in a warm place to ferment, the duration of the fermentation will depend upon the climate, in winters it might take upto 12-15 hours but during summers it might only take 8-9 hours for the batter to ferment.
The batter will fluff up slightly once fermented & it will smell a sour, it will also develop a few bubbles on the surface.
Once your batter has fermented mix it well again using a whisk or your hands & then you will have to adjust the consistency.
You will have to add 8 tablespoons of water approximately, so keep adding the water using a tablespoon while whisking it continuously to incorporate air in the batter.
The batter should become completely smooth & lacy, the consistency of it should be semi thick, if the batter is too thick then your jalebis will turn out soft & soggy, if your batter is too thin then you won’t be able to shape them properly & they will turn out to be completely flat.
Once your batter is ready, pour it into a piping bag or a squeezy bottle.
Sugar Syrup
Ingredients:
SUGAR | शक्कर 1 KG
WATER | पानी 450 ML
SAFFRON | केसर A FEW STRANDS
ORGANIC FOOD COLOUR | आर्गेनिक फूड कलर 1/2 TSP 
LEMON JUICE | निंबू का रस 1/2 TSP
Method:
Add the sugar & water into a deep pan then switch on the gas flame to high & cook until all the sugar melts.
Once the sugar melts add the remaining ingredients & cook the sugar syrup until it reaches almost one string consistency.
To check the consistency, dip a spatula or a spoon in the sugar syrup then remove it out & let it cool down slightly, then take some of the syrup on your index finger & pinch it using your thumb, when you pull your thumb away a string of the sugar should form & then break immediately.
Switch off the flame once your sugar syrup is ready, make sure you keep the sugar syrup warm when you dip fried jalebis in it. 
Frying
Ingredients:
OIL | तेल AS REQUIRED
Method:
Before frying the jalebis you will have to keep a small set up ready, you will require - a pair of tongs to fry the jalebis, a perforated spatula to dip them in sugar syrup & sieve to transfer the dipped jalebis.
Pour oil into a flat-bottomed deep pan, the level of the oil should only be an inch from the surface.
Heat the oil to 160C or until it gets moderately hot.
Once the oil is hot, cut a 1mm hole in the piping bag.
To shape the jalebis, move your hand in 2.5 circles & then moving on to shape the next jalebi in the same way, make jalebis according to the surface area of the pan, you can even change the number of circles as per your preference.
Once you have shaped the jalebis in oil, fry them until they turn light golden brown from both sides over medium flame.
Once fried, remove the jalebis from the oil & immediately dip them into the warm sugar syrup, keep them submerged in the sugar syrup for 30 seconds then transfer them into a sieve so that all the excess sugar syrup drips off.
Your perfectly fried crispy jalebis are ready, garnish them with varak & chopped pistachios before serving.

To make the filling, roughly mash the potatoes with your hands & add them into a large plate & then mash them using a potato masher.
Further add the sendha namak & arrowroot powder to the potatoes & continue to mash them, make sure you add the arrowroot powder in baches of 2 tbsp at a time.
Once you have added all the arrowroot powder, form it into a soft dough by combining all the ingredients with your hands.
Once the dough is formed, cover it with a cloth & set it aside until you make the filling.

Ingredients:
FRESH COCONUT | नारियल 1 NO. (DESICCATED)

Method:
To make the filling add the desiccated coconut into a bowl & grate in the potato.
Further add all the remaining ingredients of the filling & mix well, the filling should form a roundel by itself once everything is combined, if your filling isn’t holding its shape then you can add more grated potato to the filling.
Once your filling is ready, shape it into small lemon sized roundels.
Then take small portions of the dough & roll them into roundels that are slightly larger than the roundels of filling.
Flatten out the potato roundel by applying pressure with your palms & then place the filling in the centre.
Bring the edges of the dough together to cover the filling & seal the filling nicely by applying pressure & forming it into a round patty.
Further sprinkle some arrowroot powder & coat the patty nicely with it, your patty is now ready to be fried, shape & coat the rest of the patties similarly.
Drop the patties in medium hot oil or at 170 C very carefully, make sure you don’t stir them for the initial minute.
Then using a spoon or a ladle stir the oil gently to move the patties around in the oil, this way they will fry evenly from all side & they won’t crack.
Fry them until light golden brown, once fried transfer them onto a sieve so that all the excess oil drips off. 
Your farali pattice are ready, garnish with some desiccated coconut & chopped coriander, serve hot with farali chutney.

Make sure the rice is not fully over overcooked. There should be a little bite in it.
Once the rice is almost done, drain the water and remove the rice in a sieve or a big size thal, to evaporate the steam and to stop the further cooking process. Use a fork to fluff up the rice to avoid any breaking of the grains. Keep it aside to be used later in making the pot rice.

Method:
For the final gravy I have used an earthen pot, you can also use a normal handi.
Add the oil in the earthen pot & coat its surface well, heat the oil well. If you are using a handi then heat the handi well & then add the oil.
Once the oil gets hot add the onion, garlic, ginger & green chilli, stir well & cook until the onions turn translucent.
Once the onions turn translucent, add the kashmiri red chilli powder & the base gravy, stir well & cook over medium flame for 10 minutes.
Then set a separate pan over high flame & heat it nicely, once the pan gets hot add the oil & let the oil get hot as well.
Once the oil gets hot add the babycorn, french beans & toss over high flame for 2-3 minutes, further add carrot & the remaining vegetables, salt to taste & toss all the vegetables over high flame for 1-2 minutes & then add them into the gravy.
Further heat a teaspoon of oil in the same pan & add the onion petals & capsicum, toss them over high flame for a minute & add them to the gravy as well.
Now mix everything well in the handi & add fresh cream, butter, garam masala & the remaining ingredients & stir well, then taste & adjust the salt accordingly.
At this stage you can give the gravy a smoky flavour, to do that burn a few pieces of charcoal over direct flame & place them in a small bowl, then place the bowl in the handi & pour a few teaspoons of ghee over it & cover the handi, let the gravy smoke for 2-3 minutes & then remove the lid, this step is completely optional.
Finally, spinkle a small handful of freshly chopped coriander & your veg matka is ready.

Cheese Burst Aloo Tikki Burger | चीसबर्स्ट आलू टिक्की बर्गर | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Cheese burst aloo tikki burger 

Prep time: 25-30 minutes
Cooking time: 25-30 minutes
Serves: 7-8 tikkis


Cheese disc
Ingredients:
Processed cheese 200 grams (grated)
Butter 1.5 tbsp
Milk 130 ml
Method:
Set a double boiler, by keeping a bowl over a stock pot filled with little water, make sure the water should not touch the base of the bowl, now, add cheese, milk & butter in the bowl, whisk well and melt the cheese, whisk until the cheese is smooth in texture and it should be semi thick in consistency.
Once the cheese sauce is ready, take a square plate and line it with butter paper or a cling wrap, pour the cheese sauce and cool down to room temperature, once it cools down refrigerate until the cheese sauce sets & becomes tough. To get better results you can keep this overnight.
Once set, remove the butter paper/cling wrap and cut it in squares, remember this cheese squares will be as a filling in the tikki and the tikki has to be little smaller in size compared to the burger buns so cut it accordingly, I’ve cut it in 3 inch square and keeping 1 cm in thickness.
Keep these cheese squares in the freezer until you fill them in the aloo tikki mixture.

Creamy tangy mayo
Ingredients:
Mayonnaise ½ cup
Ketchup 2 tbsp
Red chilli sauce 1 tbsp
Methods:
In a bowl add mayonnaise, red chilli sauce and ketchup and mix well. Keep aside to be used in burger.

Crispy aloo tikki
Ingredients:
Butter 1 tbsp + Oil 1 tsp
Green chillies 2-3 nos. (chopped)
Ginger 1 tbsp (chopped)
Green peas 1/4th cup (boiled)
Potatoes 4-5 medium size (boiled & grated)
Poha (flattened rice) ½ cup (soaked)
Salt to taste
Powdered spices:
Coriander powder 1 tsp
Red chilli powder 1 tsp
Jeera powder 1 tsp
Turmeric powder 1/4th tsp
Garam masala 1 tsp
Aamchur powder 1tsp
Lemon juice ½ tsp
Fresh coriander a small handful (chopped)
For slurry:
Corn starch ½ cup
Refined flour ½ cup
Salt to taste
Oil 1 tsp
Water as required
Panko bread crumbs to coat 
Oil for deep frying
Methods:
Set a pan on medium heat, add oil & butter, let it heat and add the green chillies and ginger, sauté them for 1-2 minutes.
Further add the green peas and sauté for 1-2 minutes.
Further add the boiled potatoes, soaked poha, salt to taste, powdered spices, lemon juice and freshly chopped coriander leaves, mix and combine well, further use a potato masher and mix well while cooking for 1-2 minutes.
Once the mixture is ready, transfer in a bowl and allow to cool down to room temperature, once cooled set it in the fridge for 10-12 minutes. By the time you can make the slurry.
For slurry, take a mixing bowl and add refined flour, cornstarch, oil and salt to taste, mix well and add water to make a semi thin slurry. Also, season the panko bread crumbs by adding salt.
As the mixture is set in the fridge, take a spoonful of mixture and shape it in balls first, further press it and make a cavity to fill in the cheese squares, at this stage you have to be a little quick or else the squares will start to melt, seal it well and shape it in a tikki, make sure the size of the tikki should be little smaller than your burger buns.
Once your tikkis are filled with cheese squares and shaped, dip it in the slurry and coat it well, further coat it with dry seasoned panko bread crumbs, follow the same step to coat all the aloo tikki. 
*tip: make these tikkis and store them in freezer for up to 15 days. Don’t forget to thaw before frying.
Set oil for deep frying on medium high heat and fry the tikkis until they are crisp and golden brown. You can also choose to air fry them or bake them at 200°c for 7- 8 minutes on both the sides.
Your cheese burst aloo tikkis are ready.

Assembly 
Ingredients:
Burger buns as required
Butter to toast burger buns
Creamy tangy mayo
Fried aloo tikkis
Tomato slices as required
Onion slices as required
Cheese slices (optional)
Method:
Set a pan and add butter, toast the burger buns lightly facing on the inside, further spread the creamy tangy mayo over the top burger bun, place the aloo tikki over the bottom burger bun, place some slices of tomatoes and onions and close it with the top burger bun. Your cheese burst aloo tikki burger is ready to be served, make as many you want and serve with some crispy french fries and coke.
*tip: slice the onions and keep it in ice cold water to retain its crispiness.

Mawa Modak without Mould | बिना साँचे के मावा मोदक | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Mawa modak

Prep & Cooking time: 45- 50 minutes
Serves: 14-15 modak depending on the size

Ingredients:
MILK | दूध 1 LITRE (FULL FAT)
SAFFRON | केसर FEW STRANDS
SUGAR | शक्कर 1/2 CUP
GREEN CARDAMOM POWDER | हरी इलायची पाउडर A PINCH
GHEE | घी 1 TBSP & as required
Method:
To make the mawa modak, take a heavy bottom pan or a wok, add the full fat milk and bring it to a boil while stirring on a high flame.
Once the milk comes to a boil, lower the flame and a layer of cream will start to form, use a spatula and collect the cream on the edges of the pan.
Scrape of the cream layer stuck on the edges and repeat the process until the milk reduces to 1/3rd make sure to stir the milk to avoid it from burning. 
When the quantity of the milk reduces to half, remove little hot milk in a separate bowl and add few strands of saffron, let the kesar bloom in hot milk and bleed its natural colour, rest it for 4-5 minutes and further add it back in the milk.
Once the milk reduces to 1/3rd and the colour deepens, add sugar & cardamom powder, stir & cook until the sugar dissolves completely & the milk reduces even more further. The consistency should be like milk solids, it should grainy in texture.
Once its cooked, remove it in a bowl, and allow it cool down to room temperature.
You can shape it using a mold or can also be shaped with hands, to shape with hands, apply little ghee on your palm and take a portion of the mixture, shape it in roundels while pinching from one side to make it like a cone, further use a fork side to give creases and to look like a modak.
To shape using a mold, apply little ghee on the mold and apply the mixture tightly and close it, remove the exces mixture from the size and open it carefully, you mold shapped modak is ready.
These modaks can stay upt for 2 weeks in the fridge and stayd good for 3-4 days at room temperature.

Ukadiche Modak Recipe | Without Mould | उकडीचे मोदक | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Ukadiche modak

Prep time: 4-5 hours (drying of the rice grains)
Cooking time: 35-40 minutes
Serves: 12-15 modaks (depending on the size)

Ingredients:
For saran
 • COCONUT | नारियल 2 CUPS (DESICCATED)
 • JAGGERY | गुड 1 CUP (CHOPPED)
 • GHEE | घी 1 TBSP
 • CARDAMOM POWDER | इलाइची पाउडर A PINCH
 • NUTMEG | जायफल 1/4 NO. (GRATED)
For dough
 • TUKDA BASMATI RICE | टुकड़ा बासमती चावल 1 CUP 
 • AMBEMOHAR RICE | अंबेमोहर चावल 1 CUP
 • INDRAYANI RICE | इंद्रायणी चावल 1/2 CUP
 • WATER | पानी 1 CUP
 • GHEE | घी 1 TBSP & as required
 • SALT | नमक A PINCH
Method:
 • Start by first making of the saran (filling), we need to desiccate the coconut first by using a particular coconut desiccate machine, you can also choose to grate them but then you won’t get that texture, once the coconut is desiccated, add it in a bowl and mix it well with the jaggery, allow it to rest for at least 10 minutes.
 • Further, set a wok on low heat, add ghee and further add the coconut and jaggery mixture, cook it on low flame until the jaggery melts completely, further switch off the flame, do not cook it for long as it will become like a chikki.
 • Now, add cardamom powder & nutmeg powder, mix well and your coconut and jaggery filling / saran is ready. Now we need to make the dough or the outer covering of the modak.  
 • To make the dough or the covering of the modak, we need to first take the rice grain, ukdiche modak turns out to be perfect when used the combination of these three different types of rice, wash them only once as the starch is very important to get the perfect ukdiche modak texture.
 • After washing the rice for once, spread the rice over a cloth and let it dry completely underneath a fan for 4-5 hours or overnight. Make sure not dry in sunlight.
 • Once the grains are completely dried, we need to grind it in the chakki to get fine flour, you can grind it in a mixer grinder as well, but it won’t be that fine. Once the flour is done use a sieve and sift it well. This will give you around 3 cups of flour, but we’ll be using only 1 cup for this recipe.
 • Set a wok, add water further add 1 tbsp ghee & salt, stir and bring water to a boil, once it comes to a boil, switch off the flame and add 2 cups rice flour, mix well and cover it with a lid and rest it for 5 minutes.
 • After the rest for 5 minutes, transfer it in a parath and knead it well when it’s hot, use a bowl to knead it well to avoid burning of your hands.
 • Knead it well for 8-10 minutes or until it turns smooth and soft in texture. Apply little ghee on palm and knead it for few more minutes.
 • Your dough for making the modak is ready, to check take a small portion make it a roundel and flatten to make a paari (cup) if it doesn’t tear your dough is perfect or else you need to knead it a little more.
 • Once the kneading is done, apply little ghee over the dough and cover it with a damp cloth while you shape the modak.
 • To shape the modak, take a small portion of the dough and shape into roundels, further flatten to shape it like a cup, make sure the thickness should be of a coin size. 
 • Further fill in the cavity with the coconut and jaggery filling, further lift the ends and pinch using thumb and middle finger to make pleats, keep on making the pleats in circle and join them together to close the openings. Your ukdiche modak are ready, now we need to cook them.
 • Set a steamer on medium flame, take the steamer plate and place a muslin cloth further place the modak over the cloth, spray some water over the modak & place the plate in the steamer and steam/cook the modak for 12 min on low flame.
 • Once the modaks are cooked well remove it from the steamer and allow it to cool it down a little bit.
 • Your ukdiche modak are ready, serve them by pouring some pure ghee to elevate its flavour.

Crispy Corn Bhajiya | Spicy Sookhi Chutney | कुरकुरे कॉर्न भज्जी | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Corn Bhajiya

Prep time: 10-15 minutes
Cooking time: 15-20 minutes
Serves: 3-4 people

Ingredients:
CORN | भुट्टा 2 NOS.
SALT | नमक TO TASTE
RED CHILLI POWDER | लाल मिर्च पाउडर 1 TSP
GRAM FLOUR | बेसन 1 CUP
WATER | पानी AS REQUIRED 
Method:
To make corn bhajiyas its very important to cut the corn in a certain way, if you use whole corn kernels then the bhajiyas might splutter & lose their shape while frying, so if you get corn kernels from the market then make sure you chop them roughly.
Take a whole peeled corn & cut it into two halves, then place the cut side down & cut the corn kernels by moving the knife from top to bottom, similarly cut all the whole corn.
Now add the corn kernels in a bowl, add salt & red chilli powder, then add gram flour in batches & mix well.
Further add a splash of water & mix it well again until the mixture comes together.
To fry the bhajiyas heat the oil until it gets moderately hot or reaches 170 C.
Further scoop out small portions of the mixture & drop them in the hot oil carefully, you can dip your hand in cold water before scooping if the mixture sticks to your hand.
Fry them over high flame for a minute without stirring them then turn down the flame to medium low & fry until they turn golden brown while stirring at regular intervals.
Once fried, transfer them into a sieve so that all the excess oil drips off.
Your crispy corn bhajiyas are ready, serve hot with sukhi chutney, fried & salted green chillies & masala chai.

Sukhi chutney
Ingredients:
GRAM FLOUR | बेसन 1 CUP
SALT | नमक TO TASTE
WATER | पानी AS REQUIRED
GARLIC | लेहसुन 5-6 CLOVES (UNPEELED)
SALT | नमक TO TASTE
GARAM MASALA | गरम मसाला A PINCH
SPICY RED CHILLI POWDER | तीखी लाल मिर्च पाउडर 1 TBSP
KASHMIRI RED CHILLI POWDER | कश्मीरी लाल मिर्च पाउडर 1 TBSP
Method:
To make the sukhi chutney you’ll need to make the chura first.
In a bowl add the gram flour, salt & gradually add water as required while whisking continuously to make a semi thick besan batter.
Once your batter is ready, dip your fingers in the batter & drizzle the batter over hot oil in thin streams, once the surface of the oil gets covered, bring the chura to one side of the pan using a spider & pour more batter into the oil similarly.
Fry the chura over medium flame until it gets crisp & light golden brown then transfer it into a sieve using a spider so that all the excess oil drips off.
Now add the garlic cloves into the spider & fry them by dipping the spider into the hot oil for a few seconds then transfer them into a bowl.
Further add the chura & garlic into a chopper along with salt, garam masala, spicy red chilli powder & kashmiri red chilli powder & grind it coarsely.
Your sukhi chutney is ready.

In a mixer grinder all the ingredients leaving the hung curd, and grind to make fine paste.
In a mixing bowl or a big size thal add the prepared green paste and other remaining ingredients, mix & combine well, smoke this marinade for 3-4 minutes by pouring some ghee over burning charcoal. Your marinade for paneer pahadi tikka is ready 
Cut the paneer in either cube or cuboid depending on your preferred size, and cut the capsicum in square, keeping the size as big as paneer, cut the tomatoes in same size, using its flesh & you can use the pulp to make puree or use it any other suitable preparation, for onions, cut them in quarters and remove its petals.
Now, coat them with the pahadi marinade and skew it on a skewer along with the veggie’s, make sure to skew the veggies first and last so to keep the paneer secure between the veggies. Skew all the paneer in same way, make sure not to make the skewer heavy as the paneer may fall while cooking.
Once skewed, cook them on open flame to get the charred texture, apply melted butter all over the paneer for that distinct flavour and briefly cook them again on open flame. You can also cook them on the barbeque.
Your paneer pahadi tikka is ready, sprinkle some chaat masala over it and serve hot with some mint coriander chutney or any dip of your choice.

Moong Dal Ka Halwa Easy Recipe | आसान और स्वादिष्ट मूंग दाल का हलवा | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Moong dal halwa

Prep time: 10-15 minutes
Cooking time: 45-50 minutes
Serves: 5-6 people

Ingredients:
Yellow moong dal | पीली मूंग दाल 1 cup
Sugar syrup
Sugar | शक्कर 1 1/4 cup
Water | पानी 1 litre
Green cardamom powder | इलाइची पाउडर a pinch 
Saffaron केसर 15-20 strands
Ghee 1 cup (for cooking hlawa)
Almond | बादाम 1/4 cup (slivered)
Cashew | काजू 1/4 cup (chopped)
Rava | रवा 3 tbsp
Gram flour | बेसन 3 tbsp
Nuts for garnishing
Method:
Wash the yellow moong dal well to remove the dirt, further pat dry and allow to dry for a while.
Now set a non-stick pan and dry roast the washed moong dal on medium heat until its completely dry and the colour changes slightly.
Once roasted well, transfer over a plate and cool down completely, further transfer it in a grinding jar and grind to make coarse powder, it should not be too coarse just the powder has to be little grainy. Keep it aside to be used for making the halwa.
For the sugar syrup, add water, sugar, green cardamom powder & saffron strands, mix well and bring to a boil, once boiled switch off the flame and keep it aside to be used later in making the halwa.
Set a little big size wok on medium heat, add the ghee and let the ghee heat a little bit, further add the nuts and fry them until the colour changes to golden brown in colour, make sure to stir while frying as the colour tends to darken quickly. Remove it in a plate and keep aside.
Now in the same ghee and wok add the rava & besan, keep stirring and cook it on low flame until the colour changes to biscuity in colour and it becomes aromatic, make sure to keep stirring while cooking or it'll burn.
As the colour reaches to biscuit colour add the grounded dal powder and stir continuously on low flame until the colour changes to biscuity, during the entire process if you feel the flame is little higher and is getting darker quickly you can switch off the flame and keep stirring, this process of cooking would take a little time but it’s very important.
As the colour reaches to the biscuity colour stage add the prepared sugar syrup in batches, make sure to add the syrup in batches and be careful while adding it.
Initially you’ll feel its very watery, but the dal will soak in the water as and when you'll stir & cook, after adding the entire sugar syrup you have to keep stirring and cooking till all the moisture is absorbed and the ghee is separated. This process will take time around half an hour and you have to be patient enough.
As the ghee will start to release, increase the flame a little higher and stir & cook for 5-7 minutes, the texture of halwa will become crumbly and the colour will also darken.
Now, we can add the roasted nuts at this stage and mix well. Your moong dal ka halwa is ready. Serve warm by garnishing with slivered nuts.

Kanda Bhajji Recipe | Super Crispy Tips | कुरकुरा कांदा भज्जी बनाने का तरीक़ा | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Kanda Bhajiya

Prep time: 10-15 minutes
Cooking time: 10-15 minutes
Serves: 3-4 people

Ingredients:
ONION | प्याज़ 3-4 MEDIUM SIZED
SALT | नमक TO TASTE
KASHMIRI RED CHILLI POWDER | कश्मीरी लाल मिर्च पाउडर 1 TSP
GRAM FLOUR | बेसन 1 CUP
WATER | पानी AS REQUIRED
 Method:
To make the perfect kaanda bhajiyas, its very important to cut the onions in a certain way.
Cut the top & bottom of the onions & divide it into two equal halves by keeping the cut side down.
Further peel the onions & cut them length wise in thin slices, the slices should neither be too thin nor too thick.
After cutting the slices, separate the layers of onions using your hands, similarly cut & separate the layers of all onions & transfer them into a bowl.
Further add salt to taste & kashmiri red chilli powder, mix well & coat the onions with chilli powder & salt.
Then add the gram flour in small batches & mix well, then add a splash of water & gently knead the onions with the gram flour until everything comes together, your mixture for kaanda bhajiya is ready.
Heat oil until it gets moderately hot or 170 C, the oil should not be extremely hot or else the bhajiyas will fry from outside & remain raw in the middle.
To fry bhajiyas dip your hand in cold water & scoop out a small portion of the mixture & drop it into the hot oil without shaping it, drop all the bhajiyas in hot oil similarly, make sure that you don’t form the bhajiya into a roundel otherwise you won’t achieve the perfect texture.
Fry them over high flame without stirring them for the first 30 seconds the fry them over medium – low flame while stirring at regular intervals until they turn golden brown & crisp.
Once they turn golden brown, fry them over high flame for 30 seconds, doing this will prevent the bhajiyas from soaking the oil.
Once fried, transfer them into a sieve so that all the excess oil drips off.
Your perfectly fried crisp kaanda bhajiyas are ready.

Prep time: 20-25 minutes
Cooking time: 20-22 minutes (brownie) & 5-8 minutes (chocolate sauce)
Serves: 4 pieces of brownie square (2.5 inch)  

Tip: please use castor sugar as it'll dissolve quickly compared to grain/normal sugar.

Chocolate sauce
Ingredients:
Milk | दूध 2/3 cup (210 ml)
Castor sugar | कास्टर शुगर 1 & 1/2 cup (350 grams)
Cocoa powder | कोको पाउडर 1/3 cup (32 grams)
Salt | नमक 1/4 tsp (1 gram)
Dark chocolate compound | डार्क चॉकलेट कंपाउंड 90 grams (chopped
Butter | मक्खन 4 tbsp (60 grams)
Vanilla essence | वैनिला एसेंस 1 tsp (5 ml)
Method:
For making the chocolate sauce, set a stock pan n low heat, add sugar and milk, stir well to dissolve the milk, heat the milk and bring to a simmer.
Once it comes to a simmer switch off the flame and add the cocoa powder and salt using a sieve, stir well & use a whisk to dissolve the cocoa powder and ensure there are no lumps.
Put it back on the flame keeping it at its lowest heat possible, now add the chopped chocolate and mix well until the chocolate dissolves completely.
Now, add butter in batches and mix well to give the chocolate sauce a shine and also to adjust its consistency, adding butter make the consistency a little thicker.
Once the butter dissolves completely with the chocolate mixture, add vanilla essence to elevate its flavour.
Your chocolate sauce is ready to be used for pouring it over the sizzling brownie, you can store it in the fridge and it'll last for couple of weeks, ensure to remove the sauce with a clean spoon, you can ise this sauce for making multiple purpose.

Brownie
Ingredients:
Dark chocolate compound | डार्क चॉकलेट कंपाउंड 1/2 cup (70 grams)
Butter | मक्खन 1/4 cup (55 grams)
Castor sugar | कास्टर शुगर 1/3 cup + 1 tbsp (85 grams)
Vanilla essence | वैनिला एसेंस 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml)
Curd | दही 1/3 cup + 1 tbsp (90 grams)
Refined flour | मैदा 1/2 cup (55 grams)
Cocoa powder | कोको पाउडर 3 tbsp (16 grams)
Salt | नमक 1/8 tsp (a small pinch)
Method:
To make brownie, set a double boiler, by keeping a heat proof bowl over a stock pot filled with little water, make sure the water in the stock pot should not touch the bottom of the heat proof bowl, bring the water to boil and keep the bowl over it, add butter and chocolate in the bowl and melt them while mixing them together, once incorporated well, remove the bowl from heat and keep it over the kitchen platform.
Now add castor sugar and vanilla essence & whisk well, further add curd and whisk well until the sugar dissolves completely and the everything combines well.
Now use a sieve and add refined flour, cocoa powder and salt sift well and use a spatula, fold and combine the mixture well, do not over mix the batter.
As we are making this brownie in a pressure cooker, we need to take brownie tray that fits in the cooker, i’m taking a 5 inch ×5 inch brownie tray and lining it with baking sheet or a parchment paper, pour the batter in the tray up to 80 % and tap it well to ensure there are no air pockets in the cake mixture.
Place a cookie cutter or any stand in the cooker and preheat it on the highest flame for 10-15 minutes, once the pressure cooker gets heated well, open the lid and carefully place the brownie tray over the stand, close the lid and cook/bake the brownie for 20-25 minutes or until its completely cooked, to check insert a toothpick in the centre and if it comes out clean its baked. 
You can bake them in a preheated oven at 165℃ for 20-22 minutes or until its completely cooked.
Remove the brownie tray and allow it to cool down to room temperature, once cooled, carefully remove the brownie and cut it in square pieces. Your brownies are ready to consume. But I’ll be plating it over a sizzler pan.
Heat a sizzler pan on highest flame possible until its smoking hot, once heated well place the brownie piece and top it with a scoop of ice cream, some nuts and pour the chocolate syrup, your sizzling brownie is ready, you can place a slice of pineapple to avoid the burning of brownie.

Here i've taken yellow moong dal, washed it thoroughly and soaked it for 4-5 hours, once soaked well drain the water and use a sieve to drain off the excess water from the moong dal.
Transfer it in grinding jar and use pulse mode & grind to make semi coarse paste, make sure to add no water, if you are facing problem while grinding, then only add very little water, make sure just to mix with spoon when you grind so it'll be grinded uniformly.
Once grinded, transfer in a bowl and now, add salt, green chillies, curry leaves and freshly crushed black peppercorn. Make sure to use freshly crushed black pepper as it’s a game changer and it'll just uplift the taste of the vade.
After adding all the ingredients mix well, make sure not to whisk a lot, the batter for the moong dal vade is ready.
Now set oil for frying on medium high heat, once the oil is hot enough, dip your fingers in water and take small portion of the bhajiya batter and drop in hot oil, you do not need to shape them, they’ll form its shape once they go in hot oil.

Ingredients:
Cabbage | पत्ता गोभी 1 cup (chopped)
Carrot | गाजर ½ cup (chopped)
French beans | फंसी ½ cup (chopped)
Spring onion greens | हरी प्याज 1/4th cup (chopped)
Fresh coriander | हरा धनिया 2 tbsp (chopped)
Ginger | अदरक 1 inch (chopped)
Garlic | लेहसुन 2 tbsp (chopped)

Sugar | शक्कर a pinch
Corn flour | कॉर्न फ्लोर 6 tbsp
Refined flour | मैदा 3 tbsp
Method:
In a large bowl add chopped vegetables, along with all the seasoning & sauces, mix everything well using your clean hands, mix it lightly or else the vegetables will start releasing their moisture.
Further add the corn flour & refined flour in batches & keep mixing everything well with your hands, to check the consistency, pick a small portion of the mixture in your hand & form a ball out of it, if the mixture comes together well then you have achieved the right consistency. In total I’ve used 6 tbsp of corn flour and 3 tbsp of refined flour, you can adjust the quantity depending on the consistency of the mixture.
Set oil for frying in a wok on high heat, dip your fingers in water and take a small amount of mixture & shape it to make like balls, shape all of them.
Once shaped, drop in hot oil, on high heat and do not stir initially, allow the manchurian balls to form a layer, further lower the flame to medium low and cook the manchurian balls, so it gets cooked from inside, fry them until the colour changes to light golden brown, make sure to stir in intervals while frying. This frying process may take around 3-4 minutes.
As soon as the colour changes to light golden brown, remove it and keep in strainer and rest for 5-7 minutes. At this stage you can keep half cooked manchurian balls aside and later refry them when you’re about to make the manchurian.
To refry them, heat the oil until it becomes really hot, once the oil is really hot flash fry the half cooked manchurian balls on high heat for few seconds or until it turns super crispy and the colour changes to golden brown.
Manchurian balls are ready, keep them aside to be used for tossing it later in the sauce.

Once the pressure cooking is done, switch off the flame and let the pressure cooker depressurize naturally, further open the lid and cook the ragda by mashing it while keeping few chunky, mashing will release the natural starch from the ragda & that’ll make it thick.

KASURI METHI | कसूरी मेथी 1 TSP
FRESH CORIANDER | हरा धनिया AS REQUIRED (CHOPPED)
LEMON JUICE | नींबू का रस 1 TSP
Method:
Set a handi on high flame & let it heat well, then add the oil into it & let the oil heat nicely as well.
Further add all the whole spices & the chopped onions, stir well & cook over medium flame until the onions turn golden brown, keep stirring at regular intervals so that the onions don’t burn.
Once the onions turn golden brown add the remaining half quantity of the prepared vaatan, stir well & cook the vaatan for 3-4 minutes.
After cooking the vaatan for 3-4 minutes, lower the flame & add all the powdered spices, stir & immediately add hot water & cook until the oil separates.
Once the oil separates, add the marinated mutton & stir it well, you’ll have to cook the mutton over high flame for 10-15 minutes, you’ll need to keep stirring the mutton at regular intervals.
After cooking it for 10-15 minutes over high flame, cover the handi with a parat & pour water over it.
Now lower the flame & continue to cook the mutton for an hour or until the mutton is completely cooked.
Once the water over the parat heats up, discard it & replace it with fresh water, the water will take upto 15-20 minutes so heat up so you will have to repeat this process 2-3 times until the mutton is fully cooked.
You can also cook the mutton in a pressure cooker at this stage but cooking it over low flame gives better results.
The mutton will release a lot of moisture so make sure that you don’t add any additional water, also make a point that you don’t keep opening the lid very frequently or else the steam will keep escaping & the mutton will take longer time to cook.
Once you have cooked the mutton completely, you’ll notice that a beautiful semi-thick gravy will have formed in the handi without addition of water, if you want the gravy to be thinner you can add hot water as required to adjust the consistency as per your liking.
Now heat a pan & add ghee into it, once the ghee heats up add the garam masala & kasuri methi to the ghee & stir it well.
Pour the ghee over the mutton & add fresh coriander & lemon juice, stir it really well & finally add a small handful of fresh coriander.
Your mutton curry is ready, serve it hot with tandoori rotis, rice bhaakri & rice.

Rasgulla Recipe | Tips for Soft Roshogullas | पर्फ़ेक्ट नरम रसगुल्ला की रेसिपी | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Rasgulla

Prep time: 5-10 minutes
Cooking time: 15-20 minutes
Serves: 14-16 pieces 

Ingredients:
 • Dipping syrup
 • SUGAR | शक्कर 1 CUP / 250 GRAMS
 • WATER | पानी 2 CUPS + 1/3 CUP
 • MILK | दूध 1 LITRE (FULL FAT)
 • VINEGAR | सिरका 2 TBSP
 • WATER | पानी 2 TBSP
 • Cooking syrup
 • SUGAR | शक्कर 2 CUP / 500 GRAMS 
 • WATER | पानी 5 CUPS 
 • REFINED FLOUR | मैदा 1 TSP
 • REFINED FLOUR | मैदा 1 TBSP
 • WATER | पानी 1/4 CUP
Method:
 • First you will need to make the sugar syrup for dipping the rasgullas after cooking them.
 • In a pan or a kadhaai add the sugar & water, switch on the gas flame & cook until the sugar melts while stirring at regular intervals.
 • Once the sugar melts, switch off the flame & transfer the sugar syrup into a large bowl & set it aside until further use.
 • To make chenna, add the milk in a stock pot & bring it to a simmer, make sure that you are using full fat milk.
 • Keep stirring the milk at regular intervals to prevent it from burning, once the milk comes to a simmer, switch off the flame & let it cool down for 1-2 minutes.
 • While the milk is resting, in a separate bowl add the vinegar & water to make the vinegar solution.
 • After the milk has cooled down a bit after 1-2 minutes, start adding the vinegar solution to the milk while stirring it gently with the spatula.
 • Once the milk has curdled & all the whey gets separated, strain the curds using a sieve & a muslin cloth.
 • After straining the chenna, wash it immediately with fresh water to wash off the sourness of vinegar, & it will also stop the carry forward cooking by cooling it down.
 • Once you have washed the chenna, lift the muslin cloth & let all the excess water drip off naturally for 1-2 minutes.
 • Further squeeze the muslin cloth 2-3 times to remove more whey from the chenna, make sure you don’t squeeze out all the moisture or else your chenna will become dry.
 • Once you have squeezed it, place it back in the sieve & put some light weight over the chenna & let it rest for 5 minutes.
 • While your chenna is resting, you can start to prepare the sugar syrup that will be required to cook the rasgullas.
 • In a kadhai add the sugar & the water, switch on the flame & let the sugar syrup come to a boil.
 • While the sugar syrup comes to a boil you can continue to knead the chenna & shape the rasgullas.
 • Transfer the chenna into a large plate & crumble it, then collect it towards one side of the plate, now using the base of your palm apply pressure & start rubbing the chenna against the plate, continue doing this until the chenna becomes smooth & stops sticking to the plate, this step is very important & it will make your rasgullas extremely soft.
 • Once you have kneaded the chenna with this technique & it forms a doughball, add the flour & mix it well with the chenna & now your rasgullas are ready to be shaped.
 • Take a small portion of the chenna & place it between your palms & by applying pressure form a smooth roundel of it.
 • Make sure there are no cracks on the surface or else the rasgullas will end up splitting while cooking them, shape all the rasgullas similarly.
 • By this time the sugar syrup will become hot & now to bring it to a roaring boil cover the kadhai with a lid.
 • While the sugar syrup is coming to a roaring boil mix the flour & the water in a separate bowl to form a mixture & keep it aside until further use.
 • Once the sugar syrup comes to a roaring boil, start adding the rasgullas very carefully.
 • After adding all the rasgullas, cook them over high flame for 2-3 minutes without covering the kadhai.
 • After cooking the rasgullas for 2-3 minutes, add the prepared flour & water mixture to the syrup, now cover the kadhai with a lid & cook the rasgullas for 10-12 minutes.
 • The flour & water mixture will create a lot of froth that will cover the rasgullas from all directions, this will help them to cook evenly & puff up nicely.
 • The froth will start rising to the surface frequently, so you will need to keep lifting the lid which will prevent the froth from pouring out of the kadhai.
 • Once you have cooked the rasgullas for 10-12 minutes, switch off the flame & let them rest in the syrup for 5 minutes.
 • After they have rested, transfer the rasgullas into the dipping syrup you made earlier & let them come to room temperature.
 • Once they come to room temperature, you can consume them or place them in the fridge for 1-2 hours before consuming them.
 • Your super spongy & delicious rasgullas are ready.

As you’ll pour the dosa batter will form a mesh like texture, this texture is really important for the dosa an that’s how it makes different from the rest of the dosas. Make sure you do not over pour the dosa batter or else intead of become crispy it'll become soggy.
Once you pour the batter lower the flame and let the dosa cook on medium flame, pour some ghee or oil as per your preference.
As and when the dosa is cooking on medium flame, the moisture from the dosa will start to evaporate and that’ll make the dosa crisp. Cook until the dosa is crisp & golden brown in colour.

Kadak Rumali Roti | Tokri Khakra | Restaurant Style | कड़क करारी रुमाली रोटी | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full Written recipe for Kadak Rumali roti

Prep time: 1 hour & 15-20 minutes (includes resting time)
Cooking time: 7-8 minutes (for one roti)
Serves: 5-6 roti (depending on the roti size)

Ingredients:
Refined flour 1.5 cups
Wheat flour ½ cup
Sugar 1 tsp
Salt a pinch
Oi 1 tbsp
Luke warm Milk 1 cup 
Assembly 1:
Kadak rumali
Melted butter
Chaat masala
Kashmiri red chilli powder
Lemon juice
Mint leaves
Coriander leaves
Assembly 2:
Kadak rumali
Melted butter
Periperi spice mix
Onions (Chopped)
Tomatoes (chopped)
Green chillies (Chopped)
Lemon juice
Cheese
Nylon sev
Mint leaves
Coriander leaves
Method:
In a mixing bowl, add all the ingredients, except milk and mix well, now add milk in batches and combine well, once it becomes like a dough, transfer over the table top and knead well for 10-12 minutes.
Initially you would feel the dough is very sticky, you can just sprinkle little flour and start the kneading process.
Now you have to knead the dough by holding it from one side and stretching the other end, the stretching of the dough while kneading is very important, doing so will help the formation of gluten and later while rolling the roti, it won’t shrink or tear.
You have to knead until the dough has turned soft and smooth.
Now divide the dough into equal size dough balls, you can divide the dough balls depending on the size of the roti you want. Cover the dough balls with a damp cloth and rest it for at least 1 hour.
To cook the kadak Rumali roti, take a kadhai and flip upside down, then place it on the flame facing the bottom of the kadhai up just like a dome. Heat the kadhai very well and further lower the heat. Make sure the kadhai has to be hot but not too hot, by the time you roll the Rumali rotis keep the flame of the kadhai low so to retain its heat.
After the dough has been rested, take a dough ball & sprinkle some dry flour and flatten with hands, further use a rolling pin and roll into a very thin sheet, as thin as a handkerchief, sprinkle dry flour as and when required while rolling. You should be able to see your hands, it should be that thin.
Now, place the rolled roti over the hot kadhai, and cook the roti on low flame, use a napkin and keep turning & pressing the roti while you’re cooking so it gets cooked evenly from all side, you have to cook the roti unless the excess moisture evaporates and that will make the Rumali roti crisp.
You have to cook the roti only from one side to make it shape like a big size bowl or a dome. You have to cook on low flame, cooking on high flame will darken the colour of the roti quickly and will not make it crisp.
It'll take about 7-8 minutes to cook 1 roti, once the it becomes crisp, you’ll see the inner part of the roti has become golden brown in colour and crisp, remove carefully with napkin and let it rest for couple of minutes to make it more crisp in texture.
Once the roti has set and become crispy, you’re all set to serve the kadak rumali roti, but before that we need to add few toppings to elevate its flavour.
I’ll be making it two ways, one ill be adding some melted butter over it, sprinkle some chaat masala, kashmiri red chilli powder, lemon juice all over the kadak roti and some freshly chopped mint and coriander leaves.
Second way is, add some melted butter, peri peri spice mix, chopped onions, tomatoes, green chillies, lemon juice, grate some cheese and finish it by adding some nylon sev and freshly chopped mint and coriander leaves.

Full written recipe Steamed Mango Cheesecake

Prep time: 12-15 minutes
Cooking time: 1 hr 20 minutes
Serves: 6-7 people

Cream cheese
Ingredients:
MILK | दूध 1 LITRE (FULL FAT)
FRESH CREAM | फ्रेश क्रीम 250 ML
LEMON JUICE | निंबू का रस 1/2 - 1 NOS.
SALT | नमक A PINCH
Method:
To make homemade cream cheese add the milk & cream in a stock pot, then switch on the flame.
While stirring at regular intervals bring the milk to a simmer.
Once the milk starts simmering, switch off the flame & add the juice of half a lemon while stirring gently.
Keep stirring the milk gently until it curdles, if it doesn’t curdle add the juice of the remaining half lemon, you can also use vinegar instead of lemon juice. 
Once the milk curdles completely & all the whey gets separated strain the curds using a muslin cloth & a sieve, the whey that drains out is very nutritious & can be used to knead doughs etc.
After straining the curds rinse it using cold water nicely, this will get rid of the sour lemon flavour & will also stop the cooking process.
Further squeeze out the excess water & let is rest for five minutes.
Add it into a mixer grinder jar after it has rested & add a pinch of salt, blend it until extremely smooth, if the cream cheese gets very dry you can add a few spoons of the whey & continue to blend it until smooth.
Transfer the finely blended paste into a bowl, your homemade cream cheese is ready, place it in the fridge & let it set until you make the further components of the cheesecake.

MANGO PUREE | मेंगो प्युरी 100 GRAM (FRESH)
LEMON ZEST | निंबू का छिलका 1 NOS.
MANGOS | आम AS REQUIRED
Method:
To make the biscuit base add the glucose biscuits into a chopper, break them roughly with your hands while adding them, now using the chopper grind the biscuits into a fine powder, you can also do the same by adding the biscuits into a ziplock bag & then smashing them using a rolling pin. 
Once you have grinded the biscuits into a fine powder, add the melted butter into it & mix it well.
Transfer the biscuit mixture into a springform pan & spread it evenly, now using a potato masher flatten out the mixture on the springform pan, you can also use a bowl with a flat surface.
Place the mould in the fridge until you make the batter for the cheesecake.
To make the batter for the cheesecake add the cream cheese into a large bowl.
Further sieve the powdered sugar & corn flour directly into the bowl, now using a beater or a whisk, cream the ingredients until the mixture softens & fluffs up a bit.
Further add the condensed milk & the remaining ingredients & beat it well until all the ingredients get combined, make sure you don’t over beat it.
Once the batter is ready pour it into the springform pan with the biscuit base & then tap it gently to get rid of any bubbles formed inside.
Further cover it with aluminium foil & then place it in a steamer, let it steam for an hour at least.
While the cheesecake is getting steamed you can cut the mango slices to decorate your cheesecake, cut two large slices of the mango from the sides of the seed, then using a spoon carefully scoop out the flesh of the mango, now place the scooped-out flesh on the chopping board & cut thin slices length wise, similarly cut as many mango slices as required.
Once steamed, remove the cheesecake carefully using tongs, the cheesecake will be a little wobbly, if you think that it’s not cooked yet you can steam it further for 5-10 minutes.

Once the cheesecake sets, take it out of the fridge & unmould it from the springform pan, now to decorate the cheesecake start placing the mango slices on the edge of the cheesecake from the top, making your way inwards in a circular motion.

Aam Ka Chunda Recipe | Easy Mango Pickle | आम का छुंदा बनाइए आसानी से | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Aam ka Chunda

Prep time: 10-15 minutes
Cooking time: 6-10 days
Serves: 1.4 kg (approximately)

Notes & tips:
 • You can use ladva or rajapuri variety of raw mangoes instead of totapuri, but if you’re using ladva or rajapuri you will need to use 1.25 kg or 1250 grams of powdered sugar as these variety of raw mangoes are a bit sourer than totapuri.
 • Cleanliness is very important in the entire process of making the chunda so make sure your hands & the utensils you are using are very clean & dry, doing this will ensure that the chunda won’t spoil.
 • You can also add some additional spices like clove powder & cinnamon powder to flavour your chunda, every Indian home has their own set of spices that they add in their chunda.
 • You can also make instant chunda using the same ingredients, after grating the mangoes & mixing in the salt, turmeric & sugar, you can cook the chunda in a kadhai over very low flame until it reaches one string consistency. Once it reaches the right consistency, cool it down & add the spices, your instant aam chunda will be ready. 

Ingredients:
 • TOTAPURI MANGO | तोतापूरी आम 1 KG
 • SALT | नमक 1 TBSP
 • TURMERIC POWDER | हल्दी पाउडर 1 TSP
 • POWDERED SUGAR | पीसी हुई शक्कर 1 KG
 • KASHMIRI RED CHILLI POWDER | कश्मीरी लाल मिर्च पाउडर 2 TBSP
 • CUMIN POWDER | जीरा पाउडर 1 TBSP
 • GARAM MASALA | गरम मसाला A PINCH

Method:
 • To make aam chunda you’ll firstly need wash the totapuri mangoes very nicely & then dry them using a cloth or tissues, make sure that the mangoes are completely dry.
 • Further start peeling the mangoes, once you are done peeling the mangoes, you’ll have to grate them.
 • Start grating the mangoes through the large holes of the grater, you don’t have to use the finer holes, discard the seed of the mango once you reach the centre, grate all the mangoes similarly.
 • Transfer all the grates mangoes into a large heatproof glass bowl or a stainless-steel vessel, make sure that the bowl is clean & dry.
 • At this stage you are going to add the salt & turmeric powder, now mix everything well using your hands until everything combines.
 • Further add the powdered sugar, you’ll need to add it in batches & make sure that you sieve it before adding.
 • Add the powdered sugar in batches & mix well after adding each batch, there should be no lumps of sugar, using powdered sugar would be ideal as it melts immediately after adding & mixing it in.
 • Now cover the bowl with a muslin cloth & tie it very tightly using a string, your initial prep for the chunda is done.
 • Keep the chunda indoors overnight once you prep it till this stage.
 • The very next morning place the chunda outside on the terrace under direct sunlight till evening.
 • Bring the chunda indoors again after the sun sets, you’ll then need to open the muslin cloth & stir the chunda well using a clean spoon, the sugar settles on the bottom so stirring it is very important.
 • Cover it again with the muslin cloth & keep it indoors overnight.
 • Repeat the process of keeping it under direct sunlight then bringing it indoors & keeping it indoors overnight for 6-10 days until the sugar syrup thickens & almost reaches one string consistency.
 • Once you have repeated the process for 6-10 days & the chunda has almost reached one string consistency, you’ll have to add the further ingredients.
 • Now add the kashmiri red chilli powder, cumin powder & garam masala, stir & mix well using a clean spoon.
 • After mixing it cover it again with the muslin cloth & keep it under the sunlight for final 2 hours. 
 • After the final stage the chunda will be ready, store it in an airtight glass jar & it will last upto 1-2 years.

 • Kashmiri red chilli paste | कश्मीरी लाल मिर्च कि पेस्ट of 7-8 nos.
 • Light soy sauce | लाइट सोया सॉस 1 tsp
 • Sugar | शक्कर 1 tsp
 • Salt | नमक a pinch
Method:
 • Gochujang is a savory, sweet, and spicy fermented condiment popular in korean cooking. To make the most suitable gochujang sauce, soak the kashmiri red chillies and make a fine paste.
 • Now, set a wok on high heat, add the oil, let the oil heat and further add kashmiri red chilli paste, stir & cook the chilli paste on medium heat for 4-5 minutes & until the texture of the chilli paste becomes crumbly.
 • Further add light soy sauce, sugar & salt and cook for 2 minutes, your suitable replacement for gochujang is ready. You can use this more making many korean or korean inspired dishes.

Korean fried chicken
Ingredients:
For crispy fried chicken
 • Chicken | चिकन 1/2 kg (thighs)
 • Salt | नमक to taste
 • Garlic | लेहसुन 1 tsp (chopped)
 • Ginger | अदरक 1 tsp (chopped)
 • Black pepper | काली मिर्च a pinch
 • Corn flour | कॉर्न फ्लोर 1/2 - 3/4 cup
 • Oil for frying
For tossing in sauce
 • Gochujang | गोचुजांग 1 tbsp (or the replacement)
 • Soy sauce | सोया सॉस 1 tbsp
 • Honey | शहद 2 tbsp
 • Mirin | मिरिन 2 tbsp
 • Sesame oil | तिल का तेल 2 tsp
 • Garlic | लेहसुन 1 tsp (chopped)
 • Ginger | अदरक 1 tsp (chopped)
 • White sesame seeds (for garnish)
 • Spring onions (for garnish)
Method:
 • For making the crispy fried chicken, here I’ve used chicken thigh you can use any boneless part of the chicken, and cut into bite size.
 • Further take a mixing bowl, add the bite size chicken, ginger, garlic, salt & black pepper, and marinate the chicken well, mix it well so that every piece of the chicken gets marinated evenly.
 • Now coat the marinated chicken pieces by adding cornflour, make sure to coat it evenly and further shake to dust off the excess cornflour.
 • Set oil in a wok and heat it well, to make the chicken super crispy we need to fry the chicken two times, do the first fry by deep frying the coated chicken in hot oil on medium heat until the chicken is almost cooked and light golden brown in colour, this will take about 3-4 minutes, further remove it over a sieve and rest it for few minutes. At this stage you can keep the chicken half done and refry it later when you’re about to make the crispy korean fried chicken
 • After the first fry, heat the oil nicely, the temperature should be around 190, now refry the chicken on high heat, until the chicken turns crisp & golden brown in colour. Your crispy fried chicken is ready.
 • To make the sauce, take a wok, add the gochujang and the remaining sauce, mix well and now switch on the flame & bring the sauce to a boil, once the sauce comes to a simmer, either keep the flame to the lowest setting or switch it off, now add the crispy fried chicken and toss it well to coat the sauce evenly.
 • You do not have to cook at this stage, or else the chicken might become soggy.
 • Your crispy korean fried chicken is ready, garnish with some sesame seeds and some freshly chopped spring onion greens, serve it immediately to enjoy the crunch.

Cooking time: 10-12 minutes
Serves: 2-3 people

Ingredients:
OIL | तेल AS REQUIRED
GARLIC | लेहसुन 1 TBSP
ONIONS | प्याज़ 1/3 CUP 
CARROTS | गाजर 1/3 CUP
CAPSICUM | शिमला मिर्च 1/3 CUP
CABBAGE | पत्ता गोभी 1/3 CUP
SUGAR | शक्कर A PINCH

LIGHT SOY SAUCE | लाइट सोया सॉस 1/2 TSP
VINEGAR | सिरका 1/2 TSP
AROMAT POWDER | एरोमैत पाउडर A PINCH (OPTIONAL)
Method:
To make veg hakka noodles you will first need to pre-prep by cutting all the veggies.
Carrots 
Peel the carrot & place it onto the chopping board, trim on side of the carrot to make a flat base, turn the carrot over placing the flat side down, doing this will prevent the carrot from moving.
Further cut thin, even, diagonal slices & then arrange them in a line.
Now start cutting thing matchsticks of the carrots in one continuous motion, if you find this method difficult, you can also stack the slices together & cut evenly sized matchsticks.
Your carrot juliennes are ready.
Cabbage 
Divide the cabbage into two equal halves, place the flat side down & again cut it into two equal halves.
Trim off the stem & also remove some leaves of the core as they are hard in texture & difficult to cut.
Once you have removed the stem & core, place your hand on top of the cabbage & apply pressure to flatten it a bit.
Now start cutting thin shreds moving in one direction, this cut is called a chiffonade.
Your chiffonade cut cabbage is ready.
Capsicum
Trim off the top & bottom of the capsicum & keep it upright on the chopping board.
Then make a slit from the top to bottom, now lay the capsicum on the chopping board & insert the knife inside the slit.
Now press the blade onto the capsicum & start rolling it outwards while moving the knife with it.
This is how you will be able to get rid of the core, not spread the capsicum out & cut it into 3-4 parts, now you can cut them length or width wise, place the skin side down & just cut juliennes the same way as the carrots.
If you find this method difficult, you can also do the same by keeping the capsicum upright & then cutting the sides, this will also separate the top & bottom of the capsicum along with its core.
Onions
Peel the onions & cut them in two equal halves.
Place the flat side down on the chopping board & cut evenly sized slices length wise, make sure that the slices are neither too thick nor too thin.
Once you have cut all the slices, you will need to separate the layers of the slices.
Your perfectly cut onions for noodles are ready.
Spring onions
To cut the spring onion greens for the noodles place a bunch of them together on the chopping board & cut 1 inch long strips.
Now to cut spring onion greens for the garnish, place a bunch of spring onion greens on the chopping board & now cut the spring onions finely moving in one direction.
Your spring onions for noodles & garnish are ready.
Boiling noodles
Bring water to a roaring boil & add salt to taste along with 1 tsp of oil.
Add noodles in the boiling water & only boil them for 30 seconds or until all the noodles have separated.
Further, switch off the flame & cover it for two to two & a half minutes.
Remove them using a pair of tongs & transfer them into a sieve, rinse them will cold water immediately to stop the cooking process & drizzle some oil over them to prevent them from sticking to each other.
Your perfectly boiled noodles are ready.
Now to make veg hakka noodles, set a wok on high flame & let it heat nicely, once it gets heated add 1 tbsp of oil & let the oil heat nicely as well.
Further add garlic, onions, carrots, capsicum & cabbage, stir & cook on high flame for 30 seconds.
Now add sugar, green chilli paste, spring onion greens & boiled noodles followed by the remaining ingredients.
Stir & mix everything well & cook for one to one & a half minute.
Your veg hakka noodles are ready, garnish with some finely chopped spring onion greens.

Rumali Roti Easy Process at home | रुमाली रोटी बनाने का आसान तरीक़ा | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full Written recipe for Rumali roti

Prep time: 1 hour & 15-20 minutes (includes resting time)
Cooking time: 1-2 minutes (for one roti)
Serves: 5-6 roti (depending on the roti size)

Ingredients:
Refined flour 1.5 cups
Wheat flour ½ cup
Sugar 1 tsp
Salt a pinch
Oi 1 tbsp
Luke warm Milk 1 cup 
Method:
In a mixing bowl, add all the ingredients, except milk and mix well, now add milk in batches and combine well, once it becomes like a dough, transfer over the table top and knead well for 10-12 minutes.
Initially you would feel the dough is very sticky, you can just sprinkle little flour and start the kneading process.
Now you have to knead the dough by holding it from one side and stretching the other end, the stretching of the dough while kneading is very important, doing so will help the formation of gluten and later while rolling the roti, it won’t shrink or tear.
You have to knead until the dough has turned soft and smooth.
Now divide the dough into equal size dough balls, you can divide the dough balls depending on the size of the roti you want. Cover the dough balls with a damp cloth and rest it for at least 1 hour.
To cook the Rumali roti, take a kadhai and flip upside down, then place it on the flame facing the bottom of the kadhai up just like a dome. Heat the kadhai very well and make salt water by adding 2 tbsp salt in 200 ml of water, mix well and sprinkle over hot kadhai.
After the dough balls have been rested, take a dough ball & sprinkle some dry flour and flatten with hands, further use a rolling pin and roll into a very thin sheet, as thin as a handkerchief, sprinkle dry flour as and when required while rolling. You should be able to see your hands, it should be that thin.
Place the rolled roti over the smoking hot kadhai, don’t forget to sprinkle salt water over the kadhai before cooking the roti. It’ll take few minutes to cook on one side, use cloth and dab gently to cook the roti evenly, flip and cook on other side as well, until golden brown spots appear, fold the roti and keep aside.
Make all the roti in same way, your Rumali roti is ready, serve hot with any favourite dish of your choice.

Crispy Threaded Chicken Recipe | Restaurant Style | थ्रेडेड क्रिस्पी चिकन | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full Written recipe for Threaded chicken 

Prep time: 25-30 minutes
Cooking time: 15-20 minutes
Serves: 4-5 people

Fresh noodles
Ingredients:
Refined flour 2 cups
Salt a pinch
Water as required
Oil 1 tsp
Dry flour as required
Method:
Add the flour and salt, mix well and further add water gradually to make a dough, once combined well, transfer over the kitchen platform, add oil and knead well for 8-10 minutes, you have to knead a soft & smooth dough.
Once the dough has kneaded well, cover it with a damp cloth and rest for minimum 1 hour.
After rest, divide in equal size dough balls, i've divided in 7-8 dough balls, now cover these dough balls with moist cloth and rest for another half an hour.
Resting the dough will help to develop gluten that’ll apparently make easy while rolling the chapati for making the noodles.
Now coat the dough balls with dry flour and flatten with hands, further use a rolling pin and roll to make a small size thick chapati, roll at least 3-4 thick chapatis keeping the size equal.
Now, add little oil and spread over the chapati, further sprinkle some dry flour evenly, now place another thick chapati, and repeat the process of brushing oil and flour, stack 3-4 chapati together and now roll them into a thin chapati, use a rolling pin and roll to make one thin sheet, i’m making 3 layers sheet you can choose to make 4 layers sheet. By the time you roll the chapati keep the remaining dough balls covered to void from drying.
Set a tawa on medium heat, try to use a non-stick tawa, heat until its hot enough, add the chapati and cook briefly for 10 - 15 seconds on low flame, use napkin to turn the chapati while cooking.
Carefully try to separate the sheets after cooking briefly, repeat the process of cooking the remaining sheet briefly and separating. Cover the sheets with a moist cloth until used.
Once the sheets are ready, trim the sides to roughly make a square shape, now stack the sheets and roll it, now use a sharp knife and cut it as thin as possible.
Once its cuts into strips, separate them and keep aside to coat the chicken.

Marinating the chicken 
Ingredients:
Boneless chicken 250 grams
Ketchup 2 tbsp
Kashmiri red chilli paste of 3-4 soaked kashmiri red chillies
Green chilli paste of 2 green chilli
Kashmiri red chilli powder 1 tsp
Garam masala 1 tsp
Light soy sauce 1 tsp
Ginger garlic paste 1 tbsp
Whole egg 1 no 
Refined flour 2 tbsp
Cornflour 4 tbsp
Vinegar 1 tsp
Salt to taste
Black pepper powder a pinch
Fresh flat noodles to coat the chicken
Oil for deep frying 
Method:
Here I’m using chicken breast, you can use any boneless part as per your preference. I've washed the chicken well, and now using a sharp knife and cutting lengthwise in strips.
Further add the remaining ingredients and mix well, coat the chicken well with marinade.
Now roughly cut the noodles in a little smaller size, spread it over a flat surface and coat the marinated chicken with the noodles, press the chicken strips with hands to flatten the strips and coat it nicely.
Set hot oil in wok on medium heat, add the chicken strips in hot oil and deep fry on medium heat until the chicken is tender and its crisp and golden brown. 
Serve hot & crispy with sweet chilli sauce any other dip of your choice.

Schezwan Sauce Recipe | Never buy Schezwan Sauce again | बाज़ार जैसी शेजवान चटनी | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full Written recipe for Schezwan chutney

Soaking time: 1 hour
Prep time: 10-15 minutes
Cooking time: 15-20 minutes

Ingredients:
KASHMIRI RED CHILLIES | कश्मीरी लाल मिर्च 30-35 NOS.
HOT WATER | गरम पानी AS REQUIRED
OIL | तेल 3/4 CUP
STAR ANISE | चक्र फूल 4-5 NOS.
GARLIC | लेहसुन 1 CUP (CHOPPED)
GINGER | अदरक 1/3 CUP (CHOPPED)
CELERY | सेलरी 1/3 CUP (CHOPPED)
GREEN CHILLI PASTE | हरी मिर्च कि पेस्ट 6-7 NOS. 
SALT | नमक TO TASTE
KETCHUP | केचअप 1 CUP
RED CHILLI SAUCE | रेड चिली सॉस 1/2 CUP
VINEGAR | सिरका 1 TBSP
SOY SAUCE | सोय सॉस 1 TSP
SUGAR | शक्कर 1 TSP
AROMAT POWDER | एरोमैत पाउडर 1 TSP
WHITE PEPPER POWDER | सफेद मिर्च पाउडर 1 TSP
Method:
To make schezwan chutney you will first need to deseed & soak the Kashmiri red chillies, cut the stalk of the chilli using a pair of scissors & then split the chilli by cutting it through the middle length wise, majority of the seeds will fall off & the remaining will get separated from the chillies while soaking.
Transfer the chillies into a bowl & pour hot water until they are completely submerged, cover & soak for 1 hour at least, you can also boil the chillies for 20-25 minutes if you want to skip the soaking step.
Once they have soaked well, transfer them in a mixer grinder jar & grind them into a very fine paste using minimal amount of water.
Now to start cooing the sauce, set a wok on high flame & heat it very well.
Pour the oil into the wok and let it heat nicely, further add star anise, garlic, ginger & celery, stir & cook on high flame until the garlic turns golden brown, this process will take upto 4-5 minutes.
Once the garlic has turned golden brown, add the red chilli paste that you made along with green chilli paste & salt, cook for 15 minutes while stirring frequently, the colour of the chutney should darken & its texture should become crumbly.
At this stage you would think that there is a lot of oil, but the oil is very important as it helps to preserve the chutney & you can also use it as chilli oil while making various Chinese & Indo-chinese dishes.
When the chutney has darkened & becomes crumbly add ketchup & the remaining ingredients, stir well & cook for 3-4 minutes, you don’t have to cook a lot at this stage because you have already cooked the chillies & the sauces that you have added are already cooked.
Check for seasoning at this stage & adjust salt accordingly.
Your schezwan chutney is ready, cool it down completely before transferring it into an airtight container, you can store & use it upto 1-1.5 months if refrigerated.

• CORIANDER POWDER | धनिया पाउडर 1 TBSP
• TURMERIC POWDER | हल्दी पाउडर 1/2 TSP

• WHOLE RED CHILLIES | साबुत लाल मिर्च 3-4 NOS.
• CINNAMON | दालचीनी 1 INCH
• BLACK PEPPER CORNS | काली मिर्च 4-5 NOS.
• GREEN CARDAMOM | हरी इलायची 3-4 NOS.
• BLACK CARDAMOM | बडी इलायची 1 NO.
• BAY LEAF | तेज पत्ता 1-2 NOS.
• GINGER GARLIC PASTE | अदरक लेहसुन कि पेस्ट 3 TBSP
• GREEN CHILLIES | हरी मिर्च 3-4 NOS. (SLIT)
• ONIONS | प्याज़ 500 GRAMS (SLICED)
• FRESH CORIANDER | हरा धनिया BIG HANDFUL 
• SALT | नमक TO TASTE
• MUTTON | मटन 1 KG
• WHOLE GARLIC | साबुत लेहसुन 2 NOS.
• FRESH CORIANDER | हरा धनिया A SMALL HANDFUL (CHOPPED) (for garnish)
Method:
• Mustard oil is very important for making this recipe, as that’s how it gets its unique flavour, so start by first heating the mustard oil and heat it well until smokes appear, further switch off the flame and let the oil cool down to room temperature, now divide the oil in 60:40 parts, 60% oil will be used in marinating the mutton and the remaining 40% will be used in putting in the handi.
• As this is a one pot recipe, everything needs to be added and mixed properly with the mutton.
• The Champaran mutton also gets its unique flavour because of the utensil and the way it’s cooked, we are using earthen pot, so now add the remaining 40% of mustard oil in the handi and just swirl so the handi gets coated well.
• Now, add the remaining ingredients, that is, powdered spices, whole spices, ginger garlic paste, green chillies, onions and mix it well with mutton.
• Now add the marinated mutton in the handi and cover it with a lid and seal the edges with the dough. Make a small hole using a toothpick to allow to escape the excess steam build in while cooking.
• Set a sigdi, by adding burning coal and make sure when you keep the handi for mutton to cook the coal should not be burning hot instead it should be very low as the mutton needs to be cooked on very low heat for at least an hour, so if the heat of the sigdi will be too much, you’ll end up burning the mutton.
• As the mutton will be cooked for one hour with closed lid, you have to shake the handi carefully in every 15 minutes interval to mix well, make sure to shake the handi using a cloth.
• After cooking for an hour, remove the handi from the sigdi and allow the mutton to depressurize naturally for 10-15 minutes.
• Once depressurized, check for the doneness of the meat, by opening the lid carefully. By now the mutton shall be cooked properly and would be tender, if not, you can simply cover it with lid and cook on low flame until tis cooked and tender.
• Your mutton Champaran is ready, garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves, serve hot with chapati.

 • Now dust little flour over the chapati and place another chapati, do this layering of either 3-4 chapati.
 • Now use a sharp knife and trim the edges to make a large rectangle or square shape, now dust little more flour over the dough and fold it, make sure to do with light hands and do not press, now cut into 1 cm thick strips and cut carefully without the chapati or the layer sticking to each other. 
 • Now dust some more flour and with light hands try to separate the layers by pulling them lightly so they increase lengthwise.

 • As the kadhi seems to be cooked perfectly, add freshly chopped coriander leaves.
 • You can serve the hot kadhi by adding the pakoras 10 minutes before doing so the poakoras will be soft enough, keeping them for long time in the kadhi will make them soggy.

 • Further add little water and mix well, make sure to add very little water as the mixture needs to be combined well, and should not be anywhere pasty or thick batter.
 • Set oil in wok on medium heat, and now roughly shape the mixture and drop it in hot oil, let the pakodas fry on medium heat, until light golden brown in colour.
 • Once the colour turns light golden brown in colour, remove it over a sieve and let it rest for 5-6 minutes, by the time increase the flame to high heat and let the oil heat well.
 • Once the oil is hot enough, add the half fried pakodas and flash fry them for 15-20 seconds or until they turn crisp & golden brown, make sure to not fry them for a longer time as they may turn dark and give bitter taste.
 • Remove it over a sieve so the excess oil drains off. Keep it aside to be used to serve with the kadhi.

• Dry mango powder 1 tsp
• Kasuri methi 1 tsp
• Fresh coriander small handful
Method:
• To make the aloo mixture you will first need to make a coarsely grinded spice mix, for that take a mortar pestle & add all the whole spices into it & grind it coarsely. If you don’t have a mortar & pestle, you can do the same in a mixer grinder but make sure that you don’t make a fine powder of the spices.
• Now to make the aloo mixture, set a pan on high heat & let it heat nicely then add ghee, let the ghee heat well then add the spice mix, ginger chilli paste & the boiled green peas, stir well & cook for a minute, the green peas are already cooked, you just have to roast the spices.
• Add the diced boiled potatoes to the pan followed by all the remaining ingredients, mix everything well using a spatula & cook on medium high flame. Keep smashing the mixture lightly with the spatula while mixing.
• Spread the mixture on the pan & let it cook from one side on medium flame, the mixture should stick to the pan, this step is very important as it brings out the flavours really well, once it get slight brown, flip the mixture using the spatula & cook it the same way from the other side, repeat this process 2-3 times.
• Check for salt at this stage & adjust accordingly.
• Your aloo mixture for potli samosa is ready.

For shaping & frying:
• Once the aloo mixture is ready & the dough has rested, take the dough & divide it into equal sized dough balls.
• Roll the dough ball into a thin chapati using a rolling pin, then trim the edges of the chapati using a knife & give it a rectangular shape, now cut the larger rectangle into smaller 4-inch squares.
• Take the square samosa sheet place a small spoonful of aloo mixture on it, apply water on the edges of the sheet then lift the sheet up & place it in between your thumb & index finger, press the filling downwards to bring the 4 edges together, pinch & seal the sheet, shape all the sheets just like this & your potli samosas are now ready to be fried.
• To fry them, heat oil in a large kadhai on medium heat until it gets medium hot.
• Drop the potlis carefully in the hot oil & fry on low flame until golden brown, this process will take around 15-20 minutes.
• Once the potli samosas turn golden brown & crisp, remove them from the oil using a spider & place them in a sieve so that the excess oil drips off.
• Your hot potli samosas are ready, serve with spicy green chutney & sweet chutney.

Kolhapuri Kanda Lehsun Masala | कोल्हापुरी कांदा लहसुन मसाला | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full Written Recipe for Kolhapuri Kanda Lehsun Masala

Prep time: 10-15 minutes
Cooking time: 20-25 minutes
Serves: 600 gm

Ingredients:
 Whole kashmiri red chilli 75 grams
 Whole byadgi red chilli 60 grams
 Lavangi mirchi 120 grams
 Coriander seeds 60 grams
 Cumin seeds 25 grams
 Caraway seeds 3 grams
 Fennel seeds 12 grams
 Mustard 12 grams
 Sesame seeds 12 grams
 Poppy seeds 12 grams
 Bay leaf 5 grams
 Cinnamon 5 grams
 Star anise 5 grams
 Clove 5 grams
 Black peppercorn 12 grams
 Black cardamom 3 grams
 Green cardamom 3 grams
 Mace 3 grams
 Triphal 3 grams
 Mesua ferrea 3 grams
 Oil 3-4 tbsp
 Turmeric 12 grams
 Asafoetida 3 grams a piece
 Fenugreek seeds 3 grams
 Stone flower 3 grams
 Onions 75 grams (sliced)
 Garlic cloves 60 grams
 Ginger 25 grams
 Fresh coriander a small handful
 Fresh coconut 60 grams
 Salt 40 grams
 Ginger powder 12 grams
 Nutmeg powder 1 gram

Method:
 I'm using three 3 different types of whole red chillies, kashmiri & byadgi used for giving colour to the masala, whereas the lavangi chillies used for giving the spice element to the masala. You need to sun dry them for atleast 2 days or you can also bake them in oven at 100℃ for 20-25 minutes, or you could also toast them in the pan in batches and roast until they become crispy, the main idea is to expel the moisture present in the chillies & make them super crispy & dry, oven & sun dry works the best, after drying, remove the stem & transfer in the grinding jar, grind to make fine powder. Empty it in a big size thal
 Further, set a pan on medium heat until its moderately hot, add coriander seeds, dry roast on low flame until it’s aromatic, remove it a plate and allow to cool down.
 Further add cumin seeds, caraway seeds & fennel seeds, stir & dry roast them on low flame until its aromatic, once roasted nicely, transfer in the same bowl the coriander is in.
 Further, add mustard seeds, sesame seeds & poppy seeds, dry roast them as well until they are aromatic, and transfer them as well in the same bowl.
 Ive toasted the spices as per their sizes.

Crispy Onion Rings Recipe | Home-Made Panko Bread Crumbs| 3 Unique Dips | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Onion rings

Prep time: 20- 25 minutes
Cooking time: 25-20 minutes
Serves: 4-5 people

Panko breadcrumbs
Ingredients:
• White bread slices as required
Method:
• Panko breadcrumbs are specifically made from white part of the bread, to make them, first trim off the sides of the bread slice, and further cut the white part of the bread in cubes. Do not discard the sides as you can use them to make the normal bread crumbs that are finer in texture. You simply have to grind them in the grinding jar and further toast on a pan until the excess moisture has evaporated, you can use the finer bread crumbs not only for coating but also as a binding agent in many recipes.
• Further transfer the bread pieces in a grinding jar, use pulse mode once or twice to break down the bread pieces. Do not grid to much as we need the texture of the bread to b a little flaky, grinding more will make them into powder like consistency and that’s not what we want.
• After pulsing it for once or twice, transfer the bread crumbs over a pan, and on low heat, toast it while stirring continuously, the main reason to do is to evaporate the moisture from the bread.  You would see steam coming out while toasting and that denotes the moisture presence in the bread.
• You need to toast it until the entire moisture has evaporated, but make sure the colour shall not change even slightly.
• Once the moisture has evaporated, transfer it over a plate and cool down, as the crumbs cool down, store it in an airtight container and it stays good in the refrigerator for couple of months. Use them accordingly.

Dips
Ingredients:
Special onion ring dip
• Mayonnaise ½ cup

• Red chilli sauce 1 tbsp
• Garlic paste 1 tsp
Garlic dip
• Thick curd 1/3rd cup
• Mayonnaise 1/3rd cup
• Powder sugar 1 tsp 
• Vinegar ½ tsp
• Fresh coriander 1 tsp (finely chopped)
• Garlic paste ½ tsp
• Salt a pinch
• Black pepper a pinch
• Cold water as required
Achari dip
• Mayonnaise 1/3rd cup
• Achar masala 1 tbsp
Method:
• For special onion ring dip, add all the ingredients of the dip in a bowl & mix well, your special onion ring dip is ready, refrigerate until you serve.
• For garlic dip, add all the ingredients of the garlic dip in the bowl & mix well, you can adjust the consistency by adding cold water, if your crud is not too thick you can avoid the addition of the water, your garlic mayo dip is ready, refrigerate until you serve.
• For achari dip, simply mix achar masala and mayonnaise, your achari dip is ready, refrigerate until you serve.

Making of onion rings
Ingredients:
• Onion big size as required
For batter
• Refined flour 1 cup
• Cornflour 1/3rd cup
• Salt to taste
• Black pepper a pinch 
• Garlic powder 1 tsp
• Red chilli powder 2 tsp
• Baking powder ½ tsp
• Cold water as required
• Oil 1 tbsp
• Refined flour to coat the rings 
• Salt & black pepper to season the breadcrumbs
• Oil for frying
Method:
• Peel the onions and cut them in 1 cm thickness, separate the layer of the onions to get the rings.
• Remove the membrane which happens to be a very thin layer which is transparent & on the inside wall of every layer of the onion, try to remove if possible as it’ll make the surface a little coarse and it'll be easy for the batter to stick. 
• For making the batter, take a mixing bowl, add all the dry ingredients, and mix once, further add cold water and whisk well, add enough water to make a semi thick lump free batter, further add oil and whisk again.
• As all the components are ready, add little flour in a bowl to coat the rings, take another bowl & add the prepared panko breadcrumbs in it, season it with salt & black pepper, give a mix, keep the batter bowl next to it.
• Start by coating the rings with dry flour, shake to remove excess flour, further transfer in the batter bowl and coat it well, use a fork & lift it so the extra coating falls down in the bowl, immediately coat it nicely with seasoned panko breadcrumbs, make sure do not press while coating with crumbs as we need the texture to be flaky and crumby, let it rest for a while.
• Set oil in a wok for frying, deep fry them coated onion rings in hot oil on medium flame until its crisp & golden brown in colour.
• Remove it over a sieve so the excess oil drains off, your crispy onion rings are ready.
• Serve hot with the prepared dips or you can be creative by making your own dips.

Soaking dried fruits
Ingredients:
Kaale kishmish (black raisins) 50 grams
Bhure kishmish (brown raisins) 50 grams
Hare kishmish (green raisins) 50 grams
Dried blueberries 25 grams
Tutti fruity 50 grams
Orange juice as required
Method:
Use a glass bowl & add all the dried fruits further add orange juice as required so all the fruits are totally submerged in it, now keep it for soaking for at least 24 hours, you can also keep it for as long as a week, the more you soak the better the cake will be, make sure to keep it refrigerated while the soaking process.
Once the fruits are soaked well in the juice, use a sieve and strain the excess orange juice, reserve the orange juice to be used later in making the cake.

Molasses A.K.A. Blackjack
Ingredients:
Cheeni (sugar) 1/4th cup
Gud (jaggery) 1/4th cup
Water as required approx. 200 ml 
Method:
Set a wok on medium heat, prefer taking a little deep cavity utensil, add sugar and let the sugar caramelize on medium heat, do not stir initially, as the sugar starts to get some colour, stir once and cook until the sugar melts and becomes dark brown in colour.
Once the sugar caramelizes add the jaggery & stir continuously, cook until the jaggery dissolves completely & it turns blackish in colour, once you get that colour, switch off the flame and allow it to cool down a little bit.
Further carefully add water gradually and stir continuously, switch on the flame & cook on medium low heat until it becomes semi thick in consistency, once that consistency is achieved, switch off the flame and allow it cool down completely, as the molasses cool down it’ll become very thick, that’s the consistency we need.
Use a weighing scale & measure 50 gm of the prepared molasses, keep it aside to be used in making the plum cake.

For making the cake
Ingredients:
Dry ingredients:
Maida (refined flour) 140 grams / 1 cup
Salt 1/4th tsp
Dalchini (cinnamon) powder ½ tsp
Laung (clove) powder 1/4th tsp
Jaiphal (nutmeg) powder 1/4th tsp
Saunth (ginger) powder ½ tsp
Baking powder ½ tsp
Baking soda 1/8th tsp
Wet ingredients:
Makkhan (butter) 100 grams
Orange juice 75 grams
Brown sugar 1 tbsp
Prepared molasses 50 grams
Condensed milk 140 grams / 1/2 cup
Vanilla essence 1 tsp / 5 ml
Badam (almonds) 40 grams
Lemon peel of ½ lemon (grated)
Orange peel of 1/4th orange (grated)
Topping:
Dried cranberries
Tutti fruity
Walnuts
Almonds (slivered)
Method:
Take a little big size mixing bowl, add all the dry ingredients in sieve & sift well to add it in the bowl, keep it aside.
Further, set a pan or a wok on medium heat, add butter, orange juice, brown sugar, prepared molasses, stir & cook until the butter melts, further bring to a boil.
Now switch off the flame & allow to cool down a little bit, now add the soaked fruits, condensed milk & vanilla essence, stir & mix well. Further add this mixture to the dry ingredients & mix once, further add almonds, orange zest & lemon zest, use cut & fold method to combine the mixture well.
As all the ingredients are mixed well, when you check the consistency of the batter, it is little thick as required, to make it a little thin, add the reserved orange juice that was used for soaking the dried fruits, I’ve totally used 6 tbsp of reserved orange juice, mix well and you’ve got the perfect consistency of the cake batter.
Line a loaf tin with butter paper, I've used an 8 inch by 4-inch rectangle loaf tin, you can use a round cake tin as well, this batter will give you around 900 gm of cake so you can decide accordingly.
Pour the batter in the tin and tap it on the counter table so to remove any air pockets in the batter, top it with some dried cranberries, tutti fruity, walnuts & almond slivers, bake it in a preheated oven at 150℃ for 1 hour. 
Do not disturb the cake for at least an hour, make sure to check the process of baking keeping the oven doors closed. Check the cake after an hour for its doneness by inserting a toothpick, if it comes out clean your cake is baked to its perfection, there will also be cracks on the top surface and it denotes its baked perfectly, if the toothpick is not clean you need to bake it a little more. 
Once baked, carefully take out from the oven and allow it to cool down for few minutes.
After cooling down, run a clean knife from the sides and gently pull up the cake, remove the butter paper and your Christmas plum cake is ready.
Slice it and consume accordingly, it can be stored in the fridge for up to a week.

Kurkuri Aloo Tikki Chaat | Tips & Tricks | कुरकुरी आलू टिक्की चाट | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full Written recipe for Kurkuri aloo tikki 

Prep time: 20-25 minutes
Cooking time: 25-30 minutes
Serves: 4-5 people

Thigs to remember:
• To make the perfect crispy aloo tikki, the selection of potatoes is very important, I’ve used less starchy potatoes, you can ask your vegetable vendor, especially vendors who sell potatoes specific, you can ask them to give pahadi aloo or chipsona aloo or aloo used for making chips. I've used indori aloo which is again less in starch and it becomes super crispy when fried. 
• Makes sure there should less to no moisture in the boiled potatoes, you can adjust the moisture level by adding cornflour.
• Make sure to fry them on low heat to get even colour and crisp texture.

Prep time: 20-25 minutes (doesn’t include soaking of chana)
Cooking time: 20-25 minutes
Serves: 4-5 people

Masala chana filling
Ingredients:
• Chana dal (split chickpea) - 1/2 cup
• Salt to taste
• Ghee - 1 tbsp
• Cooked chana dal
• Fresh ginger chilli paste - 1 tbsp
• Lal mirch (red chilli) powder - 1 tsp
• Saunf (fennel) powder - 1 tbsp
• Dhaniya (coriander) powder - 1 tbsp
• Jeera (cumin) powder - 1 tsp
Method:
• Wash the chana dal thoroughly and soak it for 4-5 hours. Further set enough water in a stock pot to boil the chana dal, bring to a boil & add salt & soaked chana dal, stir once, cover & cook on medium high flame until the dal is almost cooked, this process may take 6-7 minutes, the dal should be cooked but the grain should stay intact, once it’s almost cooked, strain the dal using a sieve and discard the water.
• Cool down the dal completely, mash the dal lightly with hands, make sure to mash only 25% of the batch while keeping the remaining intact.
• Set a pan on medium heat, add ghee, cooked chana dal, fresh ginger chilli paste, powdered spices & salt, stir & cook for 4-5 minutes on low flame while stirring in short intervals.
• Masala chana dal filling is ready. Keep it aside to be used later.

Crispy aloo tikki
Ingredients:
• Boiled aloo (potatoes) - 8-10 medium size
• Salt to taste
• Jeera (cumin) seeds - 1 tsp
• Oil - 1 tbsp
• Cornflour - 2 tbsp
• Ghee - 4 tbsp (for shallow frying)
Method:
• I've used indori potatoes and boiled them, further grate the potatoes using the bigger hole and add jeera, salt, oil & cornflour, mix & combine well. Make sure not to mash very much while mixing, the addition of the cornflour totally depends on the moisture level of your potatoes, if your potatoes are dry, you can skip the addition of cornflour. 
• Once the potatoes are combined well, take a big spoonful of potato mixture and shape to make like a cup, take a small spoonful of chana dal mixture and fill in the cavity, bring the ends together and seal properly, further shape to make like a ball, make sure to press lightly while shaping like a ball. 
• Further press & flatten the ball lightly to make the tikki, make sure to be gentle to avoid the fillings from coming out.
• Set a tawa or a wide surface pan on medium low heat, add ghee for shallow frying, fry the shaped tikkis slowly on low flame on one side until its starts to get some colour or until its light golden brown in colour. Check in between while frying the potatoes for the texture & colour.
• Flip carefully & cook on other side as well until its crisp & golden brown in colour. 
• As your crispy tikki has been fried, you can consume it now by putting over some chutney or else you could make them even crispier by mashing it a little more with the spatula and re fry in moderate hot ghee on medium high flame until it turns super crispy.

Assembly
Ingredients:
• Crispy aloo tikki
• Lemon juice
• Special chaat masala (special spice mix)
• Green chutney
• Meethi chutney
• Onions (optional)
• Fresh coriander
• Ginger (juliennes)
• Beetroot (julienned)

Serves: 800-900 grams of bakarwadi

Dough
Ingredients:
Maida (refined flour) - 2 cups
Namak (salt) - 1 tsp
Gun guna tel (warm oil) - 3 tbsp
Water as required
Method:
For dough, take a big size vessel, add maida, salt and warm oil, mix and combine well, rub the flour while combining, it should hold when you press the flour.
Further add warm water gradually and knead to make a semi stiff dough. I've used less than 3/4th cup of water you can adjust accordingly.
Once the dough comes together, rest it for 10 minutes, resting the dough will help in kneading properly.
After the rest transfer the dough over the platform and knead well for 4-5 minutes or until smooth while stretching the dough. Cover with a moist cloth & rest the dough for a minimum of 30 minutes. By the time you can prepare the filling.

Bakarwadi filling
Ingredients:
Jeera (cumin seeds) - 1.5 tbsp
Dhaniya (coriander seeds) - 2 tbsp
Safed til (white sesame) - 1 tbsp
Hing (asafoetida) - 1 tsp
Spicy red chilli (teekhi lal mirch) powder - 1.5 tsp
Salt - 1.5 tsp
Nariyal (fresh coconut) - 1/2 cup
Imli ka gooda (tamarind pulp) - 4 tbsp
Gud (jaggery) - 4 tbsp
Water 50 ml
Mora sev 200 gm/3 cups
Fresh coriander a handful
Green chilli paste of 2 chillies
Method:
We need to start by first making the bakarwadi spice mix, for that, set a pan on low heat and heat until its moderately hot, add jeera seeds, coriander seeds & white sesame, dry roast on low flame until its aromatic, further transfer the roasted spices over a plate and cool down to room temperature. 
Now, divide the roasted spices in two batch and transfer one batch in a grinding jar to make fine powder whereas grind the other batch of the spices keeping the texture coarse, you can pound it in a mortar pestle or you could coarsely grind it in a mixer grinder as well.
Now mix both the batch of the powdered spices together along with hing, spicy red chilli powder & salt, mix well, your bakarwadi spice mix is ready. 
Now, again set a pan on medium heat, add the fresh coconut and dry roast on low flame to dry out its excess moisture. Transfer over a plate and cool down to room temperature.
Set another pan on medium heat, add the tamarind pulp, jaggery and water, mix well until the jaggery dissolves, stir and cook for 3-4 minutes or until the syrup is thick in consistency, take it off the heat and cool down to room temperature.
As the components for making the filling is ready, take a mixing bowl, add the mora sev, crush the sev to break down in smaller chunks, also add the roasted coconut, freshly chopped coriander leaves, green chilli paste, bakarwadi spice mix, and the prepared tamarind & jaggery syrup, I’ve added 4 tbsp of syrup you can adjust as per your convenience, but make sure adding syrup more than its requirement will make the filling moist. Mix well to distribute the syrup evenly in the mixture. Make sure not to overmix or else the sev may disintegrate.
Taste the filling to check the seasoning, sweetness & spiciness at this stage. Your filling is ready.

Peri Peri Pink Sauce Pasta | 2-minute Choco Lava Cake | Chef Sanjyot Keer #MorphyRichards,"Festive season is here & my friends were coming over & I challenged myself to cook 4 delicious recipes within 60 minutes. I have tried to simplify these recipes so that you could cook them from scratch quickly. I have cooked a cheesy dip/sauce which requires just 2 minutes to cook & you can serve it with nachos, fries, garlic bread & a lots more. I have then cooked a cheesy nachos chaat with it to give it a desi twist. My second recipe is a Peri-Peri Pink Sauce Pasta which I have cooked in mugs & you don’t require to cook red sauce or white sauce in this recipe. This is a hack & a serving style so that you can cook a desi style pasta within minutes with simple ready ingredients & with it I have served some cheese chilli garlic bread on the side. The showstopper is my Molten Choco Lava Cake which also taste a couple of minutes to cook & the batter is also super simple to make at home.

"Rasmalai Recipe | Soft, Quick & Easy Rasmalai in Microwave | Chef Sanjyot Keer #MorphyRichards","Festive season is here & what can be better than an amazing Rasmalai recipe which can be prepared in no time & you will get the best results. These rasmalais turn out super soft, they wouldn’t be dry at all & would soak up all of that milky goodness & they won’t crack at all while cooking. I have worked around a recipe with which you can prepare these rasmalais in a microwave oven & they turn out amazing. Do try the recipe this festive season & let me know in the comments. 

#YFL #GiftNewBeginnings 

Full Written Recipe for Rasmalai 

Prep time: 10-15 minutes
Cooking time: 35-40 minutes 
Serves: 17-18 rasmalai

Masala milk
Ingredients:
• Cheeni (sugar) - 1 cup 
• Pista (pistachio) - 1/4 cup (slivered)
• Badam (almonds) - 1/4 cup (slivered)
• Elaichi (cardamom) a pinch
• Kesar (saffron) - 10-12 strands
• Milk 1 litre
Method:
• Take a big size microwave safe bowl, add all the ingredients and mix well, cook in the microwave at high power for 15 minutes. Using a big size bowl will prevent the milk form spilling out. You can use nuts of your choice, and adjust the sweetness as per your preference. 
• Your masala milk for rasmalai is ready. Cool down to room temperature. By the time you can make the chena.

Rasmalai
Ingredients
• Milk 1 litre
• Water 1/4th cup + vinegar 2 tbsp
• Ice cubes as required
• Cornstarch 1 tsp
For sugar syrup
• Sugar 1 cup
• Water 4 cups
Method:
Set a heavy base wok or a stock pot on medium heat, add the milk and stir in intervals, bring to a boil, once it comes to a boil, switch off the induction or flame and stir to cool down a little bit.
In a separate bowl, add vinegar & water, mix well and this mixture gradually to the milk, stir the milk lightly while curdling the milk. Keep adding gradually until the milk solids separates from the whey (green water).
As the milk curdles, add ice cubes to stop the further cooking, use a sieve and place a muslin cloth on it, pass the milk solids (chena) through it and you can reserve the whey, rinse the chena with fresh water to remove the sourness. 
Squeeze the muslin cloth well to remove the excess moisture. You can quickly open the cloth and mix to squeeze it again to remove the excess moisture. But make sure the chena has to be slightly moist or the rasmalai won’t turn soft.
Transfer the squeezed chena over a big size thali, start to cream the chena by doing it with the heel of your palms. You need to cream it well to break down the chena granules and until its smooth and creamy in texture. The creaming process needs to be done until your hand becomes greasy that is, the chena will leaves its fat, the texture should be very smooth and creamy.
As soon as the chena start to leave the thal, collect the chena with light hands. At this stage you can add cornstarch for binding, am adding 1 tsp cornstarch, adding the cornstarch ensures the rasmalai will turn out to be perfect, you can avoid adding it if you feel your chena has the perfect consistency and won’t spoil when you shape them, it’s advisable to use cornstarch if you’re a beginner and don’t have the practice to make rasmalais.
After adding cornstarch mix well, it’ll become a soft dough, you can add more cornstarch if you feel the chena is very moist, make sure not to overdo with the addition of the cornstarch.
Once it becomes like a soft dough, the chena is ready to be shaped, cover it with a muslin cloth and make the syrup. 
For making the sugar syrup, take a big size microwave safe bowl that has a wide opening, add the water and sugar, stir well to dissolve the sugar granules, cook it microwave on high power for 12 minutes or until the chaashni starts to boil. 
By the time syrup is cooking you can shape the rasmalai tikkis.
To shape the tikkis, divide the chena in small marble size roundels, start to shape them in mini size tikkis, by shaping them between your palms, while applying little pressure and doing in a circular motion. You can also shape them in by making perfect small size balls and flatten to make them small size tikkis.
Cover the chena tikki with a moist cloth until you shape the entire batch, to avoid the chenas from drying.
As soon the chaashni boils, immediately drop in the shaped tikkis and cover it with a cling wrap and prick with a toothpick to make holes, cook the chena in boiling syrup in microwave for 12 minutes on high power. The chena will double in size so make sure you drop in the rasmalai considering the space of the bowl, you're not supposed to over crowd while cooking. 
After cooking, remove the bowl and keep it covered, let the chena rest in the syrup for 10-12 minutes, allow it to cool down.
Once the temperature drops down, squeeze the soft chena gently to remove excess syrup and immediately drop in the prepared rasmalai milk, make sure the milk is at room temperature.
Let the rasmalai rest in milk for at least 4 hours to absorb the milk, refrigerate it.
Rasmalai is ready, serve it chilled and garnish it with slivered nuts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B34vrOtsFII

• Ginger garlic chilli paste 2 tbsp
• Soft butter 2 tbsp
Method:
• Cut the boneless skin roughly in small pieces and further mince using a big knife, a cleaver, keeping few chunks, do not make a very fine mince, you can also use a food processor or a mixer grinder and coarsely mince the chicken pieces.
• Further transfer the minced chicken in a mixing bowl, and add the remaining ingredients, mix well & combine well. To make a perfect filling, the quantity of the chicken should be similar to the whole quantity of other ingredients, in other words, if the chicken is 500 gm the total quantity of other ingredients shall also be somewhere similar, its ok not be equally same.
• Your momo filling is ready, keep aside in the fridge to be used later.

For momos
Ingredients:
• Maida (refined flour) 2 cups
• Salt a pinch
• Water as required
• Sukha maida (Dry refined flour) as required
• Chicken filling
Method:
• For making the dough for the momo sheet, take a mixing bowl, add maida and salt, mix well and add water as required to knead a semi stiff dough, mix until the dough comes together, further add some dry flour and knead the dough well for 8-10 minutes, you can also transfer the dough over the kitchen platform to knead easily.
• Once the dough is kneaded, cover with a damp cloth & rest for 10-15 minutes.
• After the dough has rested, dust some more dry four and knead once again.
• Further to make the momo sheet, divide the dough equally in small marble size dough balls, now, take a rolling pin, prefer to take a slim one, and individually roll to make thin momo sheet, roll up to 3-4 inch in diameter, make sure the sheets are not too thin or too thick.
• To shape it effortlessly, take the momo sheet in hands and hold it like the way you're holding a taco shell, add sufficient amount of chicken filling in the centre and start to shape, by pinching one end together, further continue to shape by making pleats on side of the sheet and sticking on the other side & pinching on each pleat. Once the pleats are formed and it’s in semi-circle pinch once again to even the tip of the momo. This is one way for shaping the momos, you can shape in your preferred way as well.
• Once the momos have shaped, set a steamer and brush the steaming plate with oil, place the shaped momos and steam it for 15-20 minutes, you can check for its doneness by touching with your fingers, it should not stick. 
• Your hot juicy chicken momos are ready, serve hot with special momo chutney.

• Now, take a food processor or a grinding jar and add fresh coriander, spring onions, green chillies, garlic, sugar, salt & lemon juice, along with boiled Kashmiri red chillies and charred tomatoes, grind to make a semi coarse chutney, you can choose to keep it fine in texture but I like it to be little chunky so I've kept it coarse.
• Your tomato momo chutney is ready, serve with either steamed or fried momos.

 Ghee 300 gm/ 1+1/3rd cup (for shallow frying)
 Jaiphal 1/4th (grated) 
 Gud 250 gm/1+1/2 cup

Method:
 Add karkara atta and ghee in a mixing bowl & rub it well, make sure the flour sticks well & when pressed with hands it should form a shape.
 Once the ghee & atta is combined well, gradually add Luke warm water and knead to make a stiff dough.
 As the dough quantity is little more and you have to knead a stiff dough, it becomes little difficult to knead, so you can divide the dough in equal portions, and knead in batches, this makes the work much easier. Make sure to knead the dough for good 2-3 minutes.
 After kneading cover the dough with a damp cloth & rest for 15 minutes.
 After the rest, equally divide the dough in small portions, press and shape it randomly like a stick. Try not to make a thick stick or else it may remain raw from inside.

Veg Spring Roll Recipe | Home-made Spring roll Sheets with Liquid Dough | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full Written recipe for Veg Spring Roll

Prep time: 15-20 minutes
Cooking time: 15-20 minutes
Serves: 4-5 people

Vegetable filling
Ingredients:
• Oil 2 tbsp
• Lehsun (garlic) 2 tbsp (chopped)
• Adrak (ginger) 2 tbsp (chopped)
• Spring onion bulbs 2 tbsp (chopped)
• Pyaaz (onions) 1/2 cup (sliced)
• Gajar (carrots) 1 cup (julienned)
• Shimla mirchi (capsicum) 1 cup (julienned)
• Patta gobhi (cabbage) 1 cup (shredded)
• Safed mirch (white pepper) a pinch
• Salt to taste
• Hari mirchi (green chillies) paste 2 tsp
• Red chilli sauce 1 tbsp
• Ketchup 2 tbsp
• Soy sauce 2 tsp
• Kashmiri red chilli paste 2 tsp
• Vinegar 1 tsp
• Sugar 1 tsp
• Spring onion greens 
Method:
• Set a wok on high heat, add oil, garlic, ginger and spring onion bulbs, stir and cook on high heat for 1-2 minutes.
• Further add the remaining ingredients of the filling, stir & cook on high heat for 1-2 minutes.
• Sprinkle some corn flour, about ½ tsp and mix well, finish with spring onion greens and mix well, switch off the flame and allow the mixture to cool down, keep the filling aside to be used later.

Spring roll sheets
Ingredients:
• Maida (refined flour) 150 grams
• Cornflour 150 grams
• Salt a pinch
• Water 475 ml
Method:
• Take a mixing bowl, add maida, cornflour & salt, mix well add water in batches to make a smooth & lump free batter, whisk the batter well, the quantity of water may differ, we need to make the consistency batter flowy, it should not be too thick or too thin.
• To check its proper consistency, dip the spoon in the batter it should coat it while flowing. 
• Once the batter is in its appropriate consistency rest the batter for 12-15 minutes.
• Use a non-stick pan and heat until its moderately hot, use a ladle and pour the batter on the pan, take sufficient amount of batter to make a thin spring roll sheet. 
• As soon as you drop the batter swirl the pan to spread evenly to make a thin sheet. Do not use any spoon to spread like a dosa. 
• Briefly cook the sheet for 30 – 40 seconds on medium flame, use a spatula & remove it efficiently. Cook all the sheets in same way.
• If you face problem in making the sheet, for example while removing the sheet after cooking, the sheet is sticking to the pan, then water content is more in the batter and adjust by adding either cornflour or refined flour and whisk well. If the sheet is spreading evenly after swirling then your batter is thick than the required consistency. Even if the batter is perfect according to you, and still if it’s not coming out efficiently then your pan seems to be hot than the required temperature. Cook on moderately hot pan. These points are very important and do consider them while making them.
• Once the sheets are cooked perfectly place them over a grill or else place them over a plate, make sure to dust the plate with cornflour to avoid from sticking. Dust cornflour between the sheets to avoid from sticking. Keep them covered with a moist cloth until you use them for making spring rolls.

Making of spring roll
Ingredients:
•  vegetable filling
• Spring roll sheets
• Maida (refined flour) 2 tbsp
• Water 50 ml
• Oil for frying
Method:
•  in a separate small bowl, mix maida & water to make a lump free slurry.
• Take the spring roll sheet, add sufficient amount of vegetable filling, start to fold the either ends inwards to seal the openings, further roll tightly to keep the fillings intact, apply little slurry on the edges and roll to seal the edges, if there are any openings or if you notice a minor crack developing on the sheets just simply apply the slurry and deep fry them. Make all the spring rolls in same way.
• Set a wok on medium heat filled with oil, drop in the spring rolls in hot oil and deep fry them on medium heat until crisp and golden brown in colour.
• Hot & crispy spring rolls are ready, cut them in pieces and serve them hot with ketchup or any dip of your choice.

Tandoori Veg Grill Sandwich Recipe | Home-Made Tandoori Sauce | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Mumbai Veg Grill Sandwich: https://youtu.be/4EtrrCP02g8

Full written recipe for Tandoori veg grill sandwich

Prep time: 25-30 minutes
Cooking time: 5-10 minutes
Serves: 4-5 big size sandwich (depending on size)

Green spicy sandwich chutney
Ingredients:
Fresh coriander leaves 1 big bunch
Spinach 6-7 leaves (blanched)
Green chillies 10-12 nos.
Garlic 5-6 cloves
Fresh curry leaves 10-12 nos.
Sandwich masala ½ tsp
Salt to taste
Roasted chana dal 1 tbsp
Ice cubes 2-3 nos.
Methods:
Wash the coriander leaves well and transfer it to the grinding jar, you can also choose to use coriander stems as they too are full of flavours, add the remaining ingredients, grind well into a fine paste.
Make sure the chutney should be thick enough to apply on the bread. Your chutney is ready to be used as a spread on your sandwich, you can also store it in an airtight container and refrigerate it for couple of days.
You must have noticed the quantity of chillies used is too much for making this special spicy sandwich chutney, but this gives the special character to the sandwich, reason being, there’s lot of moisture in the chutney so the chefs and the street vendors just apply it little bit so the sandwich gets its spicy taste and they don’t have to apply too much which apparently makes the bread soggy. 

Red garlic chutney
Ingredients:
Kashmiri red chillies 8-10 nos. (soaked)
Spicy red chillies 8-10 nos. (soaked)
Garlic 8-10 cloves
Jeera powder 1 tsp
Black salt ½ tsp
Salt to taste
Lemon juice of 1 lemon
Water as required
Method:
Add all the ingredients in a grinding jar and grind to a fine paste, adjust the consistency by adding water, make sure the consistency is not too thin as the bread will absorb the moisture while applying over it and eventually make the sandwich soggy. 
If in case the chutney becomes thin just add few pieces of bread slice and it’ll be thick in texture. Keep aside in the fridge until you apply for making sandwich.

Tandoori sauce
Ingredients:
Sarson ka tel 1 tbsp
Kashmiri red chilli powder 2 tbsp
Jeera powder 1 tsp
Dhaniya powder 1 tbsp
Garam masala ½ tsp
Aamchur powder 1 tsp
Kala namak ½ tsp
Kasuri methi ½ tsp
Garlic ginger paste 1 tbsp
Red garlic chutney/red chili paste 2 tsp
Hung/Thick curd 1/3rd cup
Mayonnaise 2 tbsp
Salt to taste
Live charcoal + ghee 
Method:
In a mixing bowl, add mustard oil and kashmiri red chilli powder, mix well to bleed the natural red colour, further add the remaining powdered spices, ginger garlic paste, red garlic chutney, thick curd, mayonnaise & salt to taste, mix well.
Further smoke the sauce for 2-3 minutes by pouring ghee over live charcoal, discard the coal and mix the ghee with the sauce, your tandoori sauce is ready, keep aside to be used later in making the sandwich. 

Paneer vegetable filling
Ingredients:
Tomato 3/4th cup (chopped)
Capsicum 3/4th cup (chopped)
Onions ½ cup (chopped)
Sweet corn ½ cup (blanched)
Paneer 200 grams (chopped)
Fresh mint 2 tbsp (chopped)
Fresh coriander 2 tbsp (chopped)
Method:
Add all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and mix with light hands, paneer vegetable filling is ready, keep aside to be used later. You can tweak the addition of the ingredients as per your preference.
 
Assembly
Ingredients:
Sandwich bread slices
Soft butter
Spicy green chutney
Red garlic chutney
Sandwich special masala
Paneer vegetable filling
Tandoori sauce
Cheese as required 
Method:
I’m using triangle bread for making the typical grilled sandwich, you can also choose to use simple square bread available in the market, start by applying butter on one side of the bread slice, further apply tandoori sauce, now add some paneer vegetable filling, sprinkle some sandwich masala, grate cheese as per your preference, now, take another bread slice, apply butter on both the sides and apply green chutney on one side and red chutney on other side, add the paneer vegetable filling, sprinkle some more sandwich masala, grate some processed cheese over it and apply butter and tandoori sauce on another bread slice, close it to make sandwich.
Heat the griller or a grill pan until its hot, apply butter on the sandwich and grill on both the sides until the grill marks appear and its crisp in texture & golden brown in colour. You can also grill on normal pan.
Serve hot with, ketchup, green chutney or red garlic chutney and some potato chips on side.

Gulab Jamun Recipe | Tips for Soft & Perfect Gulab Jamun | परफेक्ट गुलाब जामुन  | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"#YFL #SanjyotKeer #GulabJamun

Full written recipe :

Prep time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 15-20 minutes
Serves: 24 gulab jamuns (depending on the size)

Pro tips:
* Makes sure to cream the mawa & paneer well for softer gulab jamuns.
* The oil should not be too hot while frying.
* The syrup should be warm and not hot while adding the gulab jamuns after frying.

Sugar syrup (chaashni)
Ingredients:
* Cheeni (sugar) 4 cups
* Paani (water) 3 cups
* Gulab Jal (rose water) 1 tbsp
* Choti elaichi (green cardamom) 3-4 pods
Method:
* Take a stock pot or wok, add sugar and water, keep stirring until it dissolves completely, bring to a boil & further add rose water & green cardamom, open the shell of the green cardamom to infuse its flavour, mix well & later switch off the flame. We do not require any sort of one string or two string consistency, it should just be a simple sugar syrup. 
* Keep the sugar syrup aside, no need to cool down, let the temperature drop on its own. Make sure to keep them warm.

Gulab jamun
Ingredients:
* Hariyali mawa 250 gm / 1 cup
* Malai paneer 1/4th cup / 65 gm
* Maida (refined flour) 4 tbsp
* Baking powder 1 tsp
* Oil for frying
Method:
* For making perfect soft gulab jamun we require specifically “hariyali mawa” if it’s not available you can also use fresh soft mawa, but try to use hariyali mawa for better results.
* Use a big size thal and add the mawa, if the mawa is little tough, use a grater and great to break down or else you could directly start to cream (mathna) the mawa, using the base of your palm. Cream the mawa until its smooth and creamy in texture, there should be no grains in the mawa, you need to do this process for at least 15 minutes or until the entire batch of the mawa is smooth. This process surely may be time consuming but its very important as doing this step will make you a perfect gulab jamun.
Pro tip: cream in small batches for efficient and better results.
* After creaming the mawa, take the malai paneer and grate using a small size hole, you have to cream the paneer as well in the same way as done for mawa, cream it well until its smooth in texture. You can also use chenna if not paneer.
* Once they both are smooth in texture, mix well and add maida in batches, make sure not to add them all at once, the quantity of maida will differ depending on the moisture level in the paneer and mawa, so just add in batches, you need to add & mix well until it forms like a dough and it starts to leave the parath or thal. This recipe, with this quantity won’t require more than 4 or 5 or 6 tbsp of flour.
* Once it has mixed nicely and formed a dough like texture, add baking powder and incorporate well in the dough.
* Rest the dough for 10-15 minutes & cover with a cloth, by the time you can make the chaashni.
* After making the chaashni, divide the dough in small and equal size balls, make sure to shape them in small shape as they will get bigger in size when they will soak up the chaashni.
* I have a weighing machine so it makes the process easy to keep every ball equal in size, if you have it then please use it or else you can also divide in equal portion roughly, dividing in equal size is necessary because when you’ll fry them, the bigger ones may be little uncooked whereas the smaller ones may burn quickly.
* Shape them in perfect roundels one by one and make sure there should not be any cracks on the gulab jamun, also cover the shaped balls with moist cloth to avoid them from drying, while you’re shaping few more. By the time your shaping set oil for frying.
* Set a wok filled with oil for frying the gulab jamuns, make sure the oil is not very hot, if you are having a thermometer please use it, the ideal temperature for frying the gulab jamuns should be somewhere 145- 155, if you're not having the thermometer, then drop in one gulab jamun ball to check, if it gets darken too quickly, then cool down the oil little bit. If the ball starts to float in few seconds and the bubbles start to appear then you're good to go.
* Swirl the hot oil with the spatula to make like a whirlpool, make sure to do it carefully and not spilling the hot oil over your hands, stir and add the gulab jamun balls but the spoon not touching them or else they may break, take help if required, fry in batches and do not overcrowd the kadhai.
* Fry them on low flame maintaining the temperature and keep stirring so that they get even colour and cook evenly from the inside as well.
* Once they are nice golden brown, immediately drop them in warm sugar, the temperature of the sugar should not exceed above 50 or the gulab jamun will become too soft and may lose its shape.
* Now, let the gulab jamun rest in the sugar syrup for minimum 4 hours so that they can absorb the syrup nicely. Your perfect gulab jamun is ready to be served, just warm them a little bit before serving to get that perfect soft texture.

• Parle G Biscuit 140 gm (you can use crackers biscuit too)
• Melted butter 80 gm
• Cream cheese 300 gm
• Powdered sugar ½ cup
• Fresh cream 3/4th cup
• Condensed milk 180 ml
• Vanilla extract 1 tsp
• Thick curd 1/4th cup
• Zest of 1 lemon 
• Lemon juice of half lemon
• Corn starch 1 tbsp
• Any berry compote 
Method:
• Start by first crushing the biscuit, you can use, food processor, a zip lock bag or else you can use a clean and fresh cloth to crush the biscuit, add melted butter and mix well. Add melted butter with biscuit if using food processor or a zip lock bag.
• Take a 8 inch spring form mould, and just set the base tray upside down, lock the spring form mould, doing this step will help to demould the cheesecake effortlessly.
• Transfer the butter and biscuit mixture in the spring form mould & press it with a pav bhaji masher or any flat bottom utensil, you can use a glass as well, to even the surface, press nicely to make the base of the cheese cake. Bake the base in a preheated oven at 165 ℃ for 10-12 minutes. After baking remove and allow to cool down, by the time you can make the cheese cake mixture.
 • For making the cheese cake mixture, add the cream cheese and powdered sugar in a mixing bowl, make sure to sift the powdered sugar to avoid any grains, use a electric beater or hand whisk to beat the mixture, cream the cream cheese until the mixture is creamy in texture.
• Further add fresh cream, condensed milk, vanilla extract, thick curd, lemon zest, lemon juice & corn starch, sift the cornstarch before adding, use a spatula to fold and mix well, make sure not to over mix the mixture. 
• Pour the mixture over the baked base and tap to remove any air pockets. 
• For baking cheesecake, we need to use water bath baking method also known as bain-marie, for that, use a foil paper and butter paper and wrap around the cake mould nicely. Further fill water in the baking tray and place the foil wrapped cheesecake in it.
• Now, bake the cheesecake in a preheated oven at 165 ℃ for 45-50 minutes. 
• After baking the texture of the cheese cake will be a little wobbly, run a clean knife around the sides of the cake and cool down. Remove the butter paper & foil wrap.
• Once cooled down, refrigerate in the fridge for 5-6 hours.
•  After chilling in the fridge, carefully open the lock of the spring form mould to demould, take a thin & wide spatula and remove the cake carefully.
• Your eggless New York cheese cake is ready, slice & serve as it is or just add berry compote of your choice to elevate its elegance.

Prep time: 20-25 minutes
Cooking time: 2-2.5 hours
Serves: 8-10 people

Mutton marination & cooking mutton 90% 
Ingredients:
• Hirva (Green) vatan
1. Green chillies 7-8 nos.
2. Garlic 15-20 cloves
3. Ginger 3-4 inch pieces 
4. Fresh Coriander leaves a handful
• Mutton 2 kg (washed & cleaned thoroughly)
• Salt to taste
• Turmeric powder 1 tsp
• Curd ½ cup (thoroughly whisked)
For cooking mutton 90%
• Oil 3 tbsp
• Onions 2 medium size (chopped)
Method:
• To marinate the mutton, first wash the mutton well & keep aside, we need to make hirva vatan as it is one of the elements for marinating the mutton, add the all the ingredients of hirva vatan in a grinding jar & grind to fine paste, add little water if required. 
• Now, take the washed mutton, add salt to taste, turmeric powder, hirva vatan & curd, keep about 1 tbsp hirva vatan aside for making the aalni bhaat, mix & marinate well. Refrigerate while marinating for a minimum of one hour, you can also marinate it overnight for the best results.
• Further, set a large vessel on high heat, add oil, let the oil heat nicely & add onions, cook the onions until they turn light golden brown in colour.
• Now add the marinated mutton & stir well for a minute, cook on high flame for another 10 minutes or until it starts to leaves its own water.
• Further lower the flame & cover the vessel with a lid, doing this process will develop steam in the vessel & the mutton will cook faster & it’ll be tender. Cook the mutton for minimum of 60-90 minutes, the cooking time may vary depending on the quality of the mutton. Make sure to cook the mutton until they are almost done & not completely cooked, by the time mutton is been cooked you can make other components.

Special garam masala
Ingredients:
•  Coriander seeds 4 tbsp
• White sesame seeds 3 tbsp
• Spicy red chillies 5-6 nos.
• Black cardamom 2 nos.
• Cloves 7-8 nos.
• Black peppercorns 15-20 nos.
• Sichuan peppercorns 10-12 nos.
• Naag kesar 8-10 nos.
• Star anise 1-2 nos.
• Bay leaf 2-3 nos.
• Cinnamon 2 inch
• Mace 1 no.
• A large pinch of salt
Method:
• Lightly toast all the spices on low flame until fragrant, switch off the flame & cool down the spices to room temperature, transfer the spices in a grinding jar, along with a large pinch of salt & grind into a fine powder, adding salt helps to maintain the powder texture.
• Special garam masala is ready, keep aside to be used later in making mutton.

Cooked Kala masala
Ingredients:
• Onions 7-8 medium size (washed & wiped)
• Dry coconut 1 whole
• Green chillies 8-10 nos.
• Garlic 15-20 cloves
• Ginger 2-3 inch 
• A handful of fresh coriander 
• Freshly made garam masala 2 tbsp
• Water 50 ml
• Oil 2-3 tbsp
• Very spicy red chilli powder 2-3 tbsp 
Method:
• Trim off the head of the onion & make slits, char the onions on direct flame until they are dark or black in colour. Turn & char them from all side. Similarly char the coconut & the green chillies from all side until they are dark.
• Now roughly cut the charred onions, coconut & green chillies & transfer in a grinding jar, if you want you can remove few charred bits, but I would suggest you to keep as it’ll give that distinct smoky flavour.
• Along with these elements add garlic, ginger, a handful of fresh coriander & garam masala, to the grinding jar, add little water & grind to a fine paste. Kala masala paste is ready.
• Set a iron wok on medium heat, if you’re not having the iron wok you can use any wok, using iron wok will give that intense dark colour to kala masala, add oil & very spicy red chilli powder, you can adjust the amount of red chilli powder as per your palate.
• Further add the prepared kala masala paste & cook on medium flame while stirring in regular intervals. Cook until the oil has separated from the masala. This process of cooking may take around 30 minutes.
• The masala will leave the sides of the wok/kadhai & will darken more in colour. Cook nicely until the masala is closely black in colour & then switch off the flame. This masala will be used for making kala mutton rassa & kala masala mutton.

As it has been around 75 minutes the mutton is been cooking, make sure the mutton should somewhere about 90 % cooked.

Now use a strainer & separate the mutton pieces from the stock, reserve the mutton stock as it’ll be used for making the kala mutton rassa, aalni soup & aalni bhaath & the mutton pieces will be used for making kala masala mutton 

For Kaala mutton rassa, Kaala mutton masala, Alni soup, Alni bhaat continued in the comment section below

Cheese Stuffed Paneer Tikka | Paneer Gulistani Tikka | चीज़ स्टफ्ड पनीर टिक्का | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Paneer gulistani tikka

Prep time: 15-20 minutes
Cooking time: 10-12 minutes
Serves: 4-5 skewer 

For making the paneer tikka
Ingredients:
• Paneer 500 gm
• Processed cheese 100-200 gm
• Capsicum 2-3 big size
• Tomatoes 3-4 big size
• Onions 1-2 big size
• Ghee 2 tbsp
• Besan 1/4th cup
Marinade:
• Hung curd ½ cup
• Roasted besan
• Cashew nut paste 2 tbsp
• Fresh cream 3 tbsp
• Mustard oil 1 tbsp
• Ginger garlic paste 1 tbsp
• Green chilli paste 2 tsp
• Turmeric powder 1 tsp
• White pepper powder 1 tsp
• Black pepper powder 1/4th tsp
• Jeera powder 1 tsp
• Chaat masala ½ tsp
• Coriander powder 1 tsp
• Garam masala ½ tsp
• Black salt 1 tsp
• Kasuri methi 1/4th tsp
• Rose water 2-3 drops (optional)
• Kewra water 2-3 drops (optional)
• Live charcoal + ghee (to smoke)
• Melted butter (to brush over the paneer)
Method:
• For this recipe, the shape & the size of the paneer is very important, try using a big size paneer block and further cut the paneer in cuboid shape, further slice the paneer to get a square shape slice keeping the thickness up to 0.5 cm.
• Now, take the cheese block and slice the cheese as well keeping the same size, make sure to keep its thickness lesser or half the thickness of paneer. 
• Now, place the cheese slice between two paneer slice and sandwich it, keep aside or in the refrigerator, by the time you can make the marination and the special dahi wali chutney. 
• For marinade, we need roasted besan, for that set a small pan on medium heat, add ghee and the besan, keep stirring and cook the besan until its aromatic & the colour changes slightly, do not burn, once the colour changes, transfer in a bowl & allow to cool down. Keep aside to be used in marination.
• Now, add all the marinade ingredients, along with cooled roasted besan in a mixing bowl and mix well, place a live charcoal in the marination and pour some ghee, smoke the marination for 3-4 minutes to impart the smoky flavour. Make sure the marination is thick enough.
• Now, cut the capsicum in square, keeping the size as big as paneer, cut the tomatoes in same size, using its flesh & you can use the pulp to make puree or use it any other suitable preparation, for onions, cut them in quarters and remove its petals. Once the vegetables are cut and the paneer sandwich is ready, gently coat the paneer with marination and skew it on a skewer along with the veggie’s, make sure to skew the veggies first and last so o keep the paneer secure between the veggies. Skew all the paneer in same way, make sure not to make the skewer heavy as the paneer may fall while cooking.
• Once skewed, cook them on open flame to get the charred texture, apply melted butter all over the paneer for that distinct flavour and briefly cook them again on open flame.
• You can also use a different way as well, by placing two pans of the same height on either side of the burner and place two or three skewers at a time while resting the ends on the pan, keep turning them and cook on open flame until charred from all sides. Make sure not to cook for a longer time as the cheese may drip down and the paneer needs no cooking. You can also keep the paneer size a little smaller as per your convenience, but make sure the size of the veggies, paneer & the cheese lice should be equal in square size.
• Your paneer gulistani tikka is ready, serve hot by sprinkling some chaat masala along with the dahi wali hari chutney.

For dahi wali hari chutney
Ingredients:
• Fresh coriander leaves ½ cup packed
• Fresh Mint leaves 1/4th cup packed
• Garlic 3-4 cloves

Method:
For dough, add maida, sooji, salt, ajwain and ghee, in a mixing bowl, mix well until combined well, make sure to crush the ajwain between your palms to enhance the flavour, the texture should be somewhere similar to breadcrumbs & should stick when pressed.
Add cold water gradually in the flour and knead a stiff & tight dough, knead the dough well for 7-8 minutes, after kneading cover the dough with a damp cloth and rest for 30 minutes. By the time you can prepare the filling.
For filling, we need to make the ginger & green chilli paste, for that, add green chillies & ginger in grinding jar and grind into a fine paste, keep the paste aside to be used later in making the filling.
Further, take a mortar & pestle, add jeera, saunf, & sukha dhaniya and grind to a coarse powder, you can also grind the spices in a mixer grinder, keep the powder aside to be used later in making the filling.
Cut the boiled potatoes in quarters and further slice them, keep aside for making filling.
Set a pan or a wok on low heat, add ghee, further add the grounded spices & briefly cook on low heat for 30-40 seconds, now add the ginger chilli paste, stir & cook for 1-2 minutes on low flame, further add the boiled potatoes, green peas, salt & pepper to taste, chaat masala, kasuri methi and freshly chopped coriander leaves, stir well to mix the potatoes and the masala well.
Increase the flame to medium high & cook the potatoes for 6-7 minutes, it should get some colour while cooking, mash the potatoes lightly while keeping few chunks intact. Further transfer the mixture in a bowl and allow it to cool down to room temperature. As the filling is ready, you can make the samosa.
For making samosa, make the samosa sheets, for that, knead the dough once again that has been resting & divide in equal size dough balls, further flatten the dough balls in thin sheets, making an oval shape, make sure the sheet is not too thin or too thick, divide the sheet width wise in two equal halves. Roll the sheet once again after cutting, as the sheet may shrink a little bit. 
Pick one sheet & apply water on the edge of the straight line, bring the ends together and seal well to shape like a cone, fill sufficient amount of aloo filling, while lightly pressing downwards, bring the openings of the samosa together and seal properly to shape a proper samosa. Shape all the samosa in same way, make sure to cover with a cloth while you’re shaping other samosa. By the time you can set oil for deep frying.
For frying, set oil in a big kadhai for deep frying, make sure the kadhai should be wide enough, heat the oil on medium heat and drop in the samosa, fry the samosa on medium heat until they are crisp and golden brown in colour, make sure to fry the samosa in batches but in good quantity that the kadhai is filled but do not overcrowd, make sure the oil should not be too hot, fry the samosa on low to medium flame the samosas are perfectly cooked from inside, adjust the flame accordingly, if you have a thermometer, fry the samosa at 140 ℃ - 150 ℃.
Your crispy hot samosas are ready, you can serve as it is with the chutneys of your choice or you could also take to another level by serving it with chole.

To serve, slit the pav in two, apply the thecha or sweet chutney as per your preference, add vada pav red sukha chutney, place the hot crispy vadas add some chopped onions and close, serve immediately with fried salted green chillies. Also add some chura for that extra crispiness. You can tweak the addition of elements like chutney as per your preference.

• Now, add salt & black pepper to taste, vinegar, light soy sauce, egg white & cornstarch, mix well & coat the chicken with the marinade. Make sure the coating should not be very thick. After mixing you’ll feel the chicken hasn’t coated nicely but relax the chicken will fry perfectly.
• Set oil in wok for frying, fry the marinated & coated chicken in hot oil on medium heat, until the chicken is cooked, tender & slightly golden in colour. Remove it over an absorbent paper and keep aside to be used later. Make sure not to over fry them like a chicken pakoda.
• For green chilli paste, add the green chillies in a grinding jar, add water & blend into a fine paste, keep aside to be used later.
• For making the chilli sauce, set a wok on high heat, add oil and let it heat nicely, further add onions, garlic, ginger, green chillies & coriander stems, stir & cook for 1-2 minutes or until the garlic is slightly cooked.
• Now add the chicken stock and cook for a minute on high flame.
• Further add green chilli paste, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, vinegar 1 tsp, a pinch of sugar & salt & white pepper powder to taste, stir on high flame for a minute. You can adjust the quantity of green chilli paste as per your preference.
• Now add the fried chicken & the veggies, stir briefly & cook on high flame for half a minute.
• Further add additional 100 ml of chicken stock, in a separate bowl add cornflour & water, mix well to make a slurry, add the slurry & stir well & cook for a minute or until the sauce thickens and coat the chicken.
• Taste the sauce and adjust the salt as per taste. Finish by adding some freshly chopped spring onion bulbs & greens & some fresh coriander.
• Restaurant style chilli chicken is ready, serve hot. I like to have it with some roomali roti or naan, you could also try that combination to elevate the experience of chicken chilli.

Mumbai Veg Grill Sandwich | Without Grill Machine | Sandwich Masala & Chutney | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Grill sandwich 

Prep time: 15-20 minutes
Cooking time: 5-7 minutes
Serves: 3-4 people

Special sandwich masala
Ingredients:
Whole spices
Jeera (cumin seeds) 2 tbsp
Cloves 1 tsp
Peppercorns 1 tbsp
Fennel seeds 1 tbsp
Powdered spices
Amchur powder 1 tbsp
Anardana powder 1 tbsp
Ginger powder ½ tsp 
Hing ½ tsp
Black salt 1 tbsp
Salt 4 tbsp
Methods:
Set a pan on medium heat, add the whole spice, dry roast them until fragrant, take it off from the gas and allow it to cool down.
Transfer the roasted spices to a grinding jar, further add the powdered spices and salt, grind it well into a fine powder.
Your special sandwich masala is ready, use it accordingly and store it in an airtight container in a cool and dry place. 
Please do make this masala to give your sandwich it’s distinct flavour, as the vegetables are bland in taste and this special sandwich masala has more of salt content which balances the flavour, if you do not wish to stretch the process of making this you can simply add 2 parts of chaat masala and 1 part of salt, this will do the work.

For making special spicy sandwich chutney
Ingredients:
Fresh Coriander leaves 1 big bunch
Spinach 6-7 leaves (blanched)
Green chillies 10-12 nos.
Garlic 5-6 cloves
Fresh Curry leaves 10-12 nos.
Sandwich masala ½ tsp
Salt to taste
Roasted chana dal 1 tbsp
Ice cubes
Methods:
Wash the coriander leaves well and transfer it to the grinding jar, you can also choose to use coriander stems as they too are full of flavours, add the remaining ingredients, grind well into a fine paste.
Make sure the chutney should be thick enough to apply on the bread. Your chutney is ready to be used as a spread on your sandwich, you can also store it in an airtight container and refrigerate it for couple of days.
You must have noticed the quantity of chillies used is too much for making this special spicy sandwich chutney, but this gives the special character to the sandwich, reason being, there’s lot of moisture in the chutney so the chefs and the street vendors just apply it little bit so the sandwich gets its spicy taste and they don’t have to apply too much which apparently makes the bread soggy. 
Tip: street vendors use breadcrumbs to thicken the chutney, but as we are making this back at home chana dal is a perfect substitute to thicken the chutney. If you wish to add breads to it, you can add one bread slice to make it thick. 

For sandwich special garlic chutney
Ingredients:
Kashmiri red chillies 8-10 nos. (soaked)
Spicy red chillies 8-10 nos. (soaked)
Garlic 8-10 cloves
Jeera powder 1 tsp
Black salt ½ tsp
Salt to taste
Lemon juice of 1 lemon
Water as required
Method:
Add all the ingredients in a grinding jar and grind to a fine paste, adjust the consistency by adding water, make sure the consistency is not too thin as the bread will absorb the moisture while applying over it and eventually make the sandwich soggy. 
If in case the chutney becomes thin just add few pieces of bread slice and it’ll be thick in texture. Keep aside in the fridge until you apply for making sandwich.

Assembly for making grilled sandwich
Ingredients:
Sandwich bread slices
Soft Butter
Sandwich special green chutney
Sandwich special red garlic chutney
Sandwich special masala
Potatoes (boiled)
Onions
Tomatoes 
Capsicum
Cheese
Method:
Firstly, before assembling or making the sandwich, finely chop the onions & capsicum & thinly slice the tomatoes.
I’m using triangle bread for making the typical street style grilled sandwich, you can choose to use simple bread available, start by applying butter on one side of the bread slice, further apply green chutney, now grate 1 medium size boiled potato over the bread slice, sprinkle some sandwich masala add some chopped onions & some more sandwich masala, now, take another bread slice, apply butter on both the sides and apply green chutney on one side and red chutney on other side, place the green chutney side facing the onion side, place the tomato slices over the red garlic chutney side & sprinkle some sandwich masala, add some chopped capsicum and sprinkle some more sandwich masala, grate some processed cheese over it and apply butter and green chutney on another bread slice, close it to make sandwich.
Heat the griller or a grill pan until its hot, apply butter on the sandwich and grill on both the sides until the grill marks appear and its golden brown in colour.
You can tweak the addition of the ingredients as per your preference and can also grill on normal pan.
Serve hot with, ketchup, green chutney or red garlic chutney and some potato chips on side.

Full written recipe of Punjabi aam ka achaar 

Prep time: 10-15 minutes
Bottling time: minimum 3 days
Serves: 3kg aachar 

Ingredients:
• Raw mangoes 2 kgs (ladwa variety)
• Rai (Mustard seeds) 50 gms
• Saunf (Fennel seeds) 100 gms
• Kashmiri red chilli powder 100 gms
• Haldi powder (turmeric) 50 gms
• Salt 250 gm
• Crushed Methi 100 gm
• Mustard oil (quantity given in the method section, totally used around 1 litre) 
• Hing (asafoetida) 1 tbsp
Method:
• Before starting the process of making the mangoes, it is very necessary to get the right variety of raw mango & the variety is known a “ladwa”, you’ll get them easily available in the vegetable market nearby, or you could easily ask the vendor to provide you with the same variety. 
• Once you find the right variety, wash them thoroughly with water, use a fresh scrubber to remove the few residues on the mango. 
• After washing thoroughly, wipe them dry. Cut the mangoes as your comfortable and cut into 1-inch cubes or else you could simply ask the vendor to cut the mangoes in about 1-inch cubes, but make sure you wash them thoroughly after getting from the market, pat dry them completely.
• Now, spread a clean cloth over the table or a floor where you will dry them, and spread the raw mangoes over it evenly, making sure they don’t overlap each other. Cover it with a net or other thin material cloth and sun dry them for at least 5-6 hours.
• After sun drying collect the mangoes and keep them aside for making achaar.
• Grind the mustard seeds into a powder & keep aside.
• Grind the fennel powder only about 15-20 % using the pulse mode as keeping the seeds intact as it is.
• Now, take a bowl, add the mustard powder, crushed saunf, Kashmiri red chilli powder, haldi powder, salt, crushed methi, and 400 ml of raw mustard oil, along with sun dried mangoes, mix well.
• Separately in a fry pan, heat 100 ml of mustard oil until its smoke releases. Once the smoke starts to release, switch off the flame & allow the oil to cool down a little bit, as the temperature of the oil comes down and 1 tbsp hing.
• Now cool down the oil completely and then later pour this oil over the mango & mix well.
• Now as the mangoes are mixed well with all the ingredients, its time to bottle them. Use any airtight container or a ceramic jar, make sure it’s clean & completely dried. 
• In the bottle pour some raw mustard oil and fill the bottle 3/4th with the prepared mango aachar, pour some more raw mustard oil over the aachar, the extra oil in the aachar will be its preservative, so please do not skip the addition of extra oil, you can fill approximately 100ml of raw mustard oil in each container. Seal the jar or cover with a cloth.
•  As the it bottled, now you have to keep the mangoes in direct sunlight for maturing and to get its distinct flavour. This process of bottling may take around 3-4 days. Make sure to mix everyday so the oil and masala doesn’t settle at one place.
• After the bottling process of minimum 3 days, the aachar is ready to consume, the more you wait the better it will taste, your Punjabi aachar is ready, serve it as a condiment along with your favourite delicious paratha or dal rice or anything that’s suitable to your palate along with this recipe.

Full Written recipe for Mango squash 

Mangoes are in season and I’m prepping mango squash and storing it so whenever I want to prepare some mango drink, I don’t have to cut them and take out the puree, but simply grab some homemade mango squash and voila! It’s done, and the best part is, I will give 3-4 ideas how to make 3 drinks & a popsicle idea (optional) just by using this homemade mango squash. 

Prep time: 10 - 15 minutes
Cooking time: 15-18 minutes
Serves: 2 litre squash 

For mango squash
Ingredients:
• Ripe mango puree 1 kg (will take around 8-10 nos. of ripe mango)
• Sugar 1 kg
• Water 1 litre
• Citric acid 1 tbsp
• Salt ½ tsp
Method:
• Let’s start by first removing the pulp from mangoes, we require around 1 kg of fresh mango pulp, so you can adjust the quantities of mango accordingly, wash the mangoes well & cut the side to scoop out the flesh, also to avoid the any wastage squeeze the seed as well with hands as even that has too much of pulp.
• Transfer the flesh in a grinding jar and blend into a fine puree.
• Set a wok on medium heat, add sugar and water, mix and dissolve the sugar, as soon as the sugar dissolves in water, add citric acid or you can also add lemon juice, this done remove any impurities in the syrup. The impurities fill start to float on the surface if any, make sure to discard them.
• Stir and cook until the syrup comes to one string consistency, to check, dip the spatula in the syrup and let the syrup rest for 30 seconds, then check by pinching between your thumb and index finger, you’ll see one string being formed, if it doesn’t cook it for little longer.
• Once you get the one string consistency, switch off the flame and add the fresh mango puree & salt, whisk well and pass it through a sieve, your fresh homemade mango squash is ready! keep aside and transfer in a well sterilized glass bottle, close the bottle cap or lid lightly and re-sterilize by submerging in hot water for few seconds in order to increase its shelf life.
• Allow it cool down to room temperature and it can be stored in the fridge for nice 1-2 months.

As the mango squash is ready, you can make several beverages using this as a base.

• Strain the black tea, and cool down to room temperature, once cooled down, chill in the refrigerator to make mocktails.

For mango black tea

Full written recipe for missi roti
 
Prep time: 25-30 minutes
Cooking time: 10-15 minutes
Serves: 4-5 people
 
Ingredients:
For cooking dal
• Chana dal ½ cup
• Water as required
• Salt to taste
• Haldi powder (turmeric) 1/4th tsp
For kneading the dough
• Wheat flour 2 cups
• Green chillies 2-3 (chopped)
• Fresh coriander 2 tbsp (chopped)
• Spring onions 1/4th cup (greens & bulbs)
• Onions 1/4th cup (chopped)
• Jeera ½ tsp (crushed)
• Coriander seeds 1 tbsp (crushed)
• Anardana powder 1 tbsp
• Red chilli powder 1 tsp (coarsely crushed)
• Haldi powder ½ tsp
• Salt to taste
• Oil 1 tsp
• Ghee for cooking
Methods:
• Wash the chana dal with water and soak for 4-5 hours or overnight, drain the water and transfer the soaked dal in pressure cooker, further add water, around 1 cm above the dal surface, salt to taste & haldi powder, mix & pressure cook for 4 whistles on medium flame.
• After the cooking, allow the pressure cooker to depressurize naturally to open the lid, whisk and mash the cooked chana dal and transfer in a bowl and cool down, as it cools down the texture of the dal will thicken.
• In a mixing bowl, add the ingredients of dough, leaving ghee and oil,0 along with the cooked dal, mix and combine well & add water as required to knead a soft dough. Knead well for 4-5 minutes.
• Add 1 tsp oil and knead well, further cover with a damp cloth and rest for 15-30 minutes. By the time the dough is resting, you can make the chutney and the homemade white butter.
• After the rest, divide the dough in equal size dough balls, and coat with dry flour. Flatten with hands and roll into thin sheets like a chapati. Use dry flour if required while rolling the dough. You can roll in either thick or thin missi roti as per your preference.
• Set a tawa on medium heat, add the roti and cook them from both the sides until light golden brown in colour, add some ghee over the roti and cook from both the sides until its nice crispy & golden brown in colour.
• Serve hot with homemade butter and the special green chutney.
 
For green chutney
Ingredients:
• Fresh Mint leaves 1 cup
• Fresh Coriander leaves 1/4th cup
• Spring onions ½ cup with bulbs and greens
• Green chillies 3-4 nos.
• Ginger ½ inch
• Garlic 3-4 cloves
• Jeera powder 1 tsp
• Anardana 1 tbsp
• Pickle masala 1 tbsp (any pickle of your choice)
• Salt to taste
• Lemon juice 1 tsp
• Little water
Method:
• Add all the ingredients in mortar & pestle & grind well to make chutney, if you don’t have mortar pestle, you can use blending jar & blend to make chutney. Add little water while grinding for the ease in the process. Remove and chill in the fridge until you serve them.
 
For homemade white butter
Method:
• Here I have a jar full of malai collected over 7-8 days.
• To collect malai, once you boil the milk, a layer of malai will form on the top once it cools down. Collect the malai with a slotted spoon & add it to an air tight container. Continue this process until you have at least 2 cups of malai.
• You can keep the malai in the fridge for 2-3 days or in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. Once you have enough malai you can use it to make some home-made butter.
• If your malai was set in the freezer, let it de-freeze, add the malai to a large vessel, use a spoon to continuously mix/churn the malai. Once you start mixing, you will take anywhere between 2-5 minutes to churn out the butter. Keep mixing until the texture of the malai suddenly changes.
• If that is not happening then you can add ice cold water or some ice cubes into the malai & continue the process. This usually happens in summers. In winters you might have to add some hot water instead.
• Once the texture of the malai has changed add some more chilled water & mix, the butter will separate & rise to the top. You can add some ice cubes as well so that the butter sets well.
• Now using clean hands strain out the butter, squeeze out as much moisture as possible & collect in a container & set it in the fridge before you use. You can use this butter for up to 2 days if kept in the fridge.

For homemade paneer
Ingredients: 2 litre of milk will yield approximately 500 gm of paneer
• Milk 2 litre
• Vinegar 2 tbsp + Water 100 ml
Method:
• Set a heavy bottom kadhai on medium low heat, add the milk and bring it to a light boil while keep stirring.
• Once the milk comes to a boil lower the flame and in a separate small bowl mix water and vinegar together, gradually add the vinegar solution to the boiling milk, the milk will start to curdle, if it doesn’t add some more vinegar solution, once curdled switch off the flame.
• Place a muslin cloth and a sieve & strain the curled milk/paneer. Immediately rinse the milk solids/paneer with fresh water to remove the sourness of the vinegar. Lift the muslin cloth and try to squeeze out the excess moisture. Reserve the whey (separated water while curdling the milk) as it is rich in proteins and can used in dough and gravies.
• We are using the paneer for making the paratha so we don’t need to shape them as a block, but you could choose to shape if using for other purpose, by just tie it and keep a heavy object over it so it takes a shape.
• Keep the paneer granules aside to be used in making the filling.

4. Anardana powder 1 tbsp
5. Aamchur powder 1 tsp
6. A pinch of black salt
7. Kasuri methi 1 tsp
8. Ajwain 1 tsp
• Salt to taste
• Onions 1 medium size (chopped)
Methods:
• Add all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and mix well, except the onions, as, if you're making this and storing, then prefer to add just before while making the paratha, as adding it earlier and storing may leave a bad smell of onion in the entire filling mixture.
• crumble the paneer while mixing, Keep aside.
 
For making paratha
Ingredients:
• Wheat flour 2 cups
• Salt ½ tsp
• Water as required
• Oil 1 tsp
• Dry wheat flour for dusting
• Paneer filling
• Ghee/oil/butter for cooking on tawa
Methods:
• In a bowl, add wheat flour and salt to taste, add water as required to make semi soft dough, make sure the dough is neither too soft nor too loose. Add oil and knead until the dough is smooth. Cover it with a damp cloth and rest it for 30 minutes.
• After resting, knead the dough once again, and divide the dough in equal size dough balls.
• Coat the dough balls with dry flour and flatten it with hands, use your thumb and finger to make a cup shape keeping the centre a bit thick, add sufficient amount of paneer filling and press the mixture downwards gently with thumb, bring the ends together and seal them. Remove excess dough if any.
• Now, flatten the paneer mixture filled ball gently, sprinkle some dry flour and gently flatten with hands, further roll it with a rolling pin in left upwards and right downwards movement or counter clockwise direction, do not press it hard while rolling, or the filling may come out.
• You can also choose to make paratha by making two roti and applying the paneer mixture in between just like sandwich, press the edges to seal and roll it flat without applying too much pressure.
• Set a hot tawa on medium heat, put the uncooked paratha over the hot tawa and cook it briefly from one side until light golden brown, flip and cook again briefly, now apply ghee or oil or butter and cook on both the sides until it starts to fluff and the paratha turns nice golden brown in colour.
• Cook all the parathas in the same way and make as many as you wish to, you're hot, tasty, paneer paratha is ready, serve it with some freshly grounded thecha that saved earlier & some butter or any dip of your choice.

After the rest, divide the dough in equal size dough balls. Apply little oil on the dough ball and roll into a thin chapati.
Stretch the dough from all sides while rolling to make it thinner, evenly spread oil over the chapati and sprinkle some dry flour over the chapati.
Now, fold and make pleats just by overlapping them with your fingers and further roll it from one end to other just like swiss roll. While rolling when reached in the end, tuck the end towards inside.

Your dahi wali hari chutney is ready. Keep it refrigerated until you serve it.
 
For soya chaap
Ingredients:
For frying chaap
• Soya chaap 12 nos.
• Oil for frying
For marination
• Sarson ka tel (Mustard oil) 1 tbsp
• Dahi (Curd) ½ cup
• Kaju paste (Cashew paste) 2 tbsp
• Fresh cream 3 tbsp
• Ginger garlic paste 1 tbsp
• Green chilli paste 1 tbsp
• White pepper powder 1 tsp
• Jeera powder 1 tsp
• Chaat masala 1 tsp
• Dhaniya powder (Coriander powder) ½ tsp
• Garam masala ½ tsp
• Black salt 1 tsp
• Kasuri methi 1/4th tsp
• Black pepper 1/4th tsp
• Salt to taste
• Punjabi mango achar 2 tbsp (for achari soya chaap)
For skewering:
• Skewers
• Onions ½ cup
• Capsicum ½ cup
Achari masala powder:
• Mustard seeds 1 tsp
• Cumin seeds 1 tsp
• Fennel seeds 1 tsp
• Kalonji 1/2 tsp
• Methi seeds 1/2 tsp
• Ajwain 1/2 tsp
• Kashmiri red chili powder 2 tbsp
• Aamchur powder 2 tsp
Method:
Transfer all the ingredients in a grinding jar and grind to a fine powder.
Method:
• Am using the canned soya chaap, you can use frozen chaap as well, remove the stick from the chaap and fry in hot oil on medium high flame until crisp and golden brown. Cut the fried chaap in 2-3 pieces and keep aside for marinating.
• As am doing 2 different marination, one is afghani and one is achari, I’ll divide the soya chaap by putting 6 sticks in afghani and reaming 6 in achari. You can make any of the marination as per your preference.
• For afghani marination, add the all the ingredients of marination except the Punjabi mango aachar and whisk well, add the fried soya chaap pieces and mix well, marinate for 15-20 minutes.
• For achari soya chaap, just add 2 tbsp of Punjabi mango achar masala (if you're adding the mango piece as well make sure to grind along with the masala), and mix it with the afghani marinade made, and further marinade the soya chaap for the same time. You can also use the regular achar masala or the achar powdered masala, along with achar masala add little mustard oil as well for the flavour.
• After marinating for 15-20 minutes, take a skewer and skew the marinated soya chaap along with some diced capsicum and onion petals. If you're having bamboo skewers make sure to soak them in water for at least 30 minutes.
• Once skewed, cook them on open flame to get the charred texture, apply melted butter all over the chaap for that distinct flavour and recook them briefly on open flame.
• If you're having oven at home, you can simply avoid the step of frying the soya chaap and simply marinate the soya chaap pieces and cook them in a preheated oven at 200 for 7-8 minutes or until you get charred texture over the chaap.
• You're afghani soya chaap/achari soya chaap is ready. You can serve at this stage as well with the dahi wali hari chutney. But I would suggest you to add few more ingredients just to elevate the elegance of the dish.
 
Assembly
Ingredients:
• Charred soya chaap tikka
• Melted butter
• Fresh cream
• Onions rings
• Lemon juice
• Chaat masala
Method:
• Remove the chaap from the skewer, and add the other ingredients in order, mix lightly and serve immediately with some onion rings, dahi wali hari chutney and some chillies and lemons on side.

Home-made Strawberry Jam Recipe | Fresh Strawberry Jam with basic ingredients | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Strawberry Jam 

Prep time – 10 minutes
Cooking time – 1 hour
Serves – 450 grams

Ingredients:
• Strawberries 900 gm
• Sugar 400 gm
• Salt a pinch
• Vinegar 1 tbsp

Methods:
• Wash the strawberries thoroughly and pat dry them, further trim if the head with the leaves and cut the strawberries in quarters or smaller chunks as per your preference, if you like you jam to be smooth, I like my jam to be little chunkier.
• Transfer the chopped strawberries in a wok, most preferably use a non-stick wok, add sugar, salt a pinch and vinegar, mix well and then switch on the flame to low heat. Addition of salt and vinegar will bright up the colour, flavours and also help to maintain the shelf life.
• Lightly stir until the sugar dissolves completely, continue to cook on low flame while stirring in regular intervals and throughout the cooking process, by now the mixture will turn slight watery.
• Once the strawberries have softened mash them with help of the spatula. 
• After 10 minutes of cooking increase the flame to medium flame.
• The cooking process will melt & cook the sugar and also breakdown the strawberries. Once the sugar has melted, it’ll start to boil and has also thickened slightly.
• Remove and discard the froth formed on the top while cooking.
• After cooking for 45-60 minutes, check for its readiness by, dropping a dollop of jam on a plate, allow to cool down for a while and tilt the plate, if the jam slides, it’s runny and you need to cook it for few more minutes and if it stays, strawberry jam is done.
• Make sure not to cook too much, as the jam will thicken as it’ll cools down.

For storing the jam:
• Store the jam in a well sterilized glass jar for maintaining its shelf life, for sterilizing, set water in a stock pot and boil the glass jar, spoon and tong for few minutes, make sure the glass used should be heat proof. Remove from boiling water and let the steam escape & the jar dries completely.
• Now add the jam in the jar, you can add the jam even if it’s warm, close the lid and re dip in the boiling water for few minutes, in order to increase the shelf life.
• To store the jam in the fridge, allow the jam to cool down to room temperature after the second dip and you can refrigerate it for good 6 months.

Prep time: 15 mins

Serves: it can serve a family of four for 3-4 days, depending on the quantity being served, suggested to make at least 1-1.5 kg of carrots so you can enjoy this delicacy for days, store in the fridge for up to 4-5 days and warm it before serving. 

Ingredients:
• Carrots 1 kg
• Milk 3 litres
• Sugar 300 gm
• Cardamom powder 2 tsp
• For roasting nuts:
1. Ghee 4-5 tbsp
2. Cashew nuts 1/4th cup (slivered)
3. Almonds 1/4th cup (slivered)
• Slivered Pistachios (for garnish)
• Raisins 2 tbsp
Methods:
• Wash & Peel the red carrots and grate it, use a larger grating side.
• Set a deep base heavy bottom pan on medium heat and add milk, bring the milk to a boil while keep stirring in intervals.
• By the time milk comes to a boil, roast the nuts by setting a pan on medium heat, add ghee and nuts, roast the nuts until light golden brown and aromatic. Keep aside to add later in the halwa.
• 
• Once the milk comes to boil, add the grated carrots and continue to cook on medium high heat or medium heat, depending on the quantity & the vessel size.
• I have used 1:3 ratio of carrots to milk, you can use a minimum of 1:1 ratio, more the milk, richer will be the texture of the halwa & longer the time it will take to cook. I suggest to use at least 1:2 ratio of carrots to milk.
• The milk should always be on a simmering boil, keep stirring occasionally, initially you do not require to stir a lot as the milk quantity is quite a lot.
• Once the milk starts to reduce & thicken, start stirring more frequently, cook until the milk has reduced completely.
• This process might take about 90-120 minutes depending on the quantity of the milk & carrots
• Once the milk has reduced completely, add sugar and cardamom powder and mix well, stir and cook for another 25 minutes on medium flame. Stir continuously at this stage as there is no liquid and there are chances to burn.
• Now, add the roasted nuts and raisins to the halwa, stir well and cook for 10-15 minutes. addition of raisins is optional but it elevates the flavour.
• Gajrela, also known as Gajar ka halwa is ready to be served, serve this delectable sweet by garnishing it with slivered nuts of your choice.

Dal Makhani Recipe | Restaurant Style Recipe | दाल मख्नी होटल जैसी | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full written recipe for Restaurant Style Dal Makhani Recipe


Sabut urad dal 250 grams (whoe black gram lentil) 
Water to rinse & soak
Water to cook – 4-5 litres + as required


For the tadka:


Desi Ghee - 4tbsp
Ginger garlic paste - 2 tbsp
Deghi/ kashmiri red chilli powder - 3 tbsp
Fresh tomato puree - 500 grams
Salt to taste
White butter - 4 tbsp
A pinch of homemade garam masala (optional)
Toasted kasuri methi - 1/2 tsp
White butter - 3 tbsp
Fresh cream - 1/2 cup


Method:


• Wash & rinse the dal really well. You will have to scrub the dal between your palms so that all the impurities are discarded & also the dal will slightly loose its color. You will have to wash the dal for 3-4 times, I washed it for 3 times. 
• Once the dal is washed & the water is clear, add enough water to soak & soak the dal for a minimum of 4-5 hours or overnight. 
• Once the dal is soaked, drain the excess water & now add the dal into a large vessel. 
• Add enough wate & bring the water to a boil. 
• Now lower the flame & cook the dal for 60-90 minutes. Stir in intervals but with very light hands & not in very short intervals. 
• I do not add the salt early into the dal & prefer to add it in the tadka & towards the end. 
• Scum will start to form on the top, remove & discard. 
• Once the dal is cooked well, you should be able to crush the dal between your fingers very easily & you should feel the starchy goodness squeezing out of the dal. 
• You can continue to cook the dal until you prep the tadka or set it aside. 
• You can also cook the dal in a pressure cooker for 4-5 whistles & you would require lesser water as per your pressure cooker requirements. 


For the tadka:


• Add desi ghee into a vessel, now add in the ginger garlic paste. Cook on low flame for 2-3 minutes. Now add in the red chilli powder & cook om low flame for a minute. Remember to not burn the chilli. If you feel the heat is too high, just sprinkle some water to avoid the burning of the chilli powder. 
• Now add in the fresh tomato puree, salt to taste & cook on medium to high flame until the tomatoes are cooked really well & the ghee is released. 
• Now set the dal again on a flame & add the tadka to it. 
• Mix well & now add the white butter, you can add unsalted butter as well, or use normal butter & adjust the salt accordingly. 
• Now cook the dal on low flame for 30-45 minutes, longer the better. Keep stirring in intervals.
• Use a whisk or a wooden mathani to mash the dal to a consistency you like. The more you mash, the creamier would be the texture. 
• After about 45 minutes, add toasted kasuri methi powder, a pinch of garam masala which is optional but do add because we did not use any whole spices. Mix well. 
• Now lower the flame to the minimum & finish with white butter and the fresh cream. 
• Mix gently & cook for 4-5 minutes. 
• The dal is ready to be served. 
• Remember, this dal tends to thicken very quickly so whenever you feel that the dal is very thick, add HOT water, remember the water should be hot, even when you cook this dal in advance the dal will be really thick if it gets cold, reheat, adjust the consistency with hot water, bring to a boil before you serve. 
Cheers!

Japchae & Dak Galbi Recipe | Korean Cooking For Indian Homes by Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Hi Guys! I came across this incredible book Korean cooking for Indian homes by the Korea Tourism Organization. There are 10 simplified Korean recipes & you can download the cookbook for free by clicking on this link! 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zla9LB7IGbzBMJ-Yfh6LbvR0nQ45WruA/view?usp=sharing 

Request a free copy of ‘Korean Cooking for Indian Homes’ at india@knto.or.kr 

I prepared two recipes from the book & they turned out to be super delicious & were so easy to prepare. 

Food fact: Korean foods are served all at once. Unlike Western meals that are served in multiple courses, a Korean expects all dishes to be served together. The table decoration changes according to the number of items being served, with the number of banchan or side dishes anywhere between five and twelve.

Ingredient trivia & substitutions: 

Glass Noodles: Authentically glass noodles are used for Japchae, I have used rice noodles, you can also use rice noodles in stead which are widely available & if you do not get those too easily, you could use flour noodles too. 

Gochu-garu: Gochu garu is a red hot Korean chilli powder, you could use a spicy red chilli powder in replacement. 

Gochujang: Gochujang is a traditional Korean condiment made by fermenting a mixture of chilli pepper powder with other ingredients and is used in many recipes. I would not recommend you to replace this ingredient because it has a specific flavour profile which is important for this recipe & also it is widely available in stores & online. If you do not find this ingredient then you could use a red chilli paste which you can prepare at home, the flavour though would be quite different but yet delicious & you could enjoy the recipe. 

Corn Syrup- You can use honey or maple syrup 

Chives- Use Spring onion greens 

Unrefined sugar- You can use regular sugar syrup

Enjoy Korean cooking & do try these recipes & let me know your experience in the comment box.

No Oven Eggless Chocolate Brownie Recipe | बिना अवन बिना अंडे की ब्राउनी | Sanjyot Keer,"Full Written recipe for No oven Eggless brownie 

Ingredients: (for 8 × 8-inch baking tray)
 Refined flour (maida) 3/4th cup
 Cocoa powder 1/3rd cup
 Salt 1/4th tsp
 Baking powder 2 tsp
 Dark compound Chocolate 1 cup (chopped)
 Butter ½ cup
 Yogurt 3/4th cup
 Vanilla extract 1 tsp
 Sugar 3/4th cup

Methods:
 First, start by choosing the method of baking your brownie, if you have oven at home please preheat the oven at 180℃, or in case if you don’t have oven need not worry, you can bake it in either cooker or kadhai, just simply add 1 kg of salt in your preferred vessel, then place a stand that’ll be used for keeping the baking tray. Do not discard this salt as it can be reused for baking other recipes.
 Line an 8 × 8-inch baking tray or any size baking tray, that is suitable for your vessel, with a butter paper and keep aside.
 Take sieve, add refined flour, cocoa powder, salt and baking powder, sift them together and keep them aside. 
 Set a double boiler, add chocolate and butter and melt it completely, you can also choose to microwave it for 30 seconds or until they are melted.
 Further, add yogurt, vanilla extract and sugar, in the melted chocolate, whisk well until the sugar dissolves completely, you can also choose to use castor sugar that melts much faster compared to normal grain sugar.
 Add this liquid mixture to the dry mixture of flour, mix well till its combined properly, I haven’t used any nuts because I like my brownie to be simple, you can choose to add nuts of your choice at this step of combining.
 Transfer the mixture to butter paper lined tray and tap the tray to remove excess air.
 Put the tray for baking, if your baking in oven then bake it at 180℃ for 25-30 minutes or, bake this in your preferred vessel for at least 45-50 minutes. 
 To check whether the brownies are cooked or no, just insert a toothpick, if it comes clean your brownie is baked perfectly.
 If your baking in a vessel, then make sure not to check at every interval as the heat may escape and may take more time to bake. Check it after 25-30 minutes.
 The baking time may defer depending on the size of your vessel.
 Make sure to rest the brownies for at least 30 minutes before cutting them.
 Once the brownies are cooled down, cut into your preferred shape and share with your family and friends. Elevate the elegance of brownie by topping it with a scoop of vanilla or chocolate ice cream and drizzle some chocolate sauce.

"Pindi Chole Bhature Recipe | No Onion, No Garlic, No Tomato | Fluffy Bhatura | Chef Sanjyot Keer","Full Written Recipe for Pindi Chole Bhature

For bhatura
Ingredients:
Maida (refined flour) 2 cups
Sooji/rava (semolina) 1/4th cup
Powdered sugar 1 tbsp
Baking powder ½ tbsp
Baking soda 1 tsp
Salt 1/4th tbsp
Curd 1/4th cup
Ghee 2 tbsp
Water ½ cup + 2 tbsp
Oil for frying bhature
Method:
In a mixing bowl add all the dry ingredients & mix once, further add, curd, ghee & mix well, next, slowly add the water & knead well to make a soft & stretchy dough.
At first you may find that your dough is too sticky, but don’t worry just knead it well for at least 10-15 minutes, as & when you’ll knead the dough, it will become soft & smooth.
Apply little ghee over the dough, cover it with a damp cloth & rest it for minimum 1 hour in a warm place, ideal place can be switched off oven or any warm place in the kitchen, by the time you can start making the special pindi chole masala.
Once the dough resting is done, briefly knead the dough again & shape the dough into equal size dough balls, to ensure the perfect bhaturas, rest the dough balls for 10 minutes.
Flatten it with h&s & further roll it in round or oblong shape, drizzle oil if it sticks to the surface.
Set oil in kadhai for deep frying the bhaturas on high flame, wait until the oil is smoking hot, slide the bhature in smoking hot oil & gently push the bhatura inside the oil with the spatula, this will allow the bhature to fluff immediately, flip & carefully splash hot oil with the spatula so the puri starts to fluff evenly & quickly, this will give a nice golden colour as well, fry the bhature until it golden brown & are fluffy as balloon. 
Your bhaturas are ready, serve them hot with hot pindi chole.

For special pindi chole chana masala
Ingredients:
Whole spices:
Jeera 2 tbsp
Coriander seeds 3 tbsp
Black peppercorns 1 tbsp
Cloves 5 nos.
Bay leaves 3 nos. 
Cinnamon stick 2 inch
Chakri phool 1 no.
Black cardamom 3 nos.
Green cardamom 5-6 nos.
Mace 1 no.
Whole dry red chillies 4-5 nos.
Powdered spices:
Kasuri methi 1 tbsp
Methi seeds 1/4th tsp
Anardana powder 3 tbsp
Amchur powder 1 tbsp
Red chilli powder 1 tbsp
Black salt 2 tsp

For pindi chole
Ingredients:
Raw Chickpea 2 cups
For potli masala:
Black tea powder 2 tbsp
Black peppercorns 5-6 nos.
Cloves 3-4 nos.
Cinnamon stick 1 inch
Bay leaf 1 no.
Green cardamom 3 no.
Black cardamom 1 no.
Salt to taste
Baking soda ½ tsp
Water as required for cooking chole
Hing 1 tsp
Green chillies 4-5nos. (slit)
Ginger 1/4th cup (juliennes)
Special pindi chole masala 4 tbsp
Salt to taste
Ghee 1.5 cups 
Garnish: chopped coriander leaves, ginger juliennes
Methods:
Wash the raw chickpea & soak it overnight or minimum for 6-8 hour.
Drain the water & wash the chickpea thoroughly with fresh water. 
For potli masala, take a muslin cloth & add, black tea powder & the whole spices, tie it to make it like a potli.
IN a pressure cooker add the chole, masala potli, add salt to taste, baking soda & masala potli & mix well, close the lid & pressure cook on medium flame for 3-4 whistles. 
Allow the pressure cooker to depressurize naturally, & then open the lid.
Strain the chole from the water, using a sieve, keep the water as its full of flavour & it’ll be needed in further cooking process. Remove & discard the tea & masala potli.
Transfer the cooked chole to a separate wok, I’ve used iron wok to give the chole its dark colour, you can use other wok as well if in case you don’t have iron wok. Make sure the wok is not on the gas stove.
Further add hing, slit green chillies, ginger, special pindi chole masala & salt to taste, mix gently & keep it aside for half an hour.
Heat 1.5 cup ghee in a separate pan until its smoking hot, further remove 3-4 tbsp of ghee separately to add in khatte wale aloo, & add the remaining smoking hot ghee to the masala coated chana & mix gently for 2-3 minutes.
Put the wok on gas stove & turn on the heat to low flame, further, add the flavoured chole reserve water to the chole in batches, & cook the chole by mixing it gently. Make sure you don’t add too much, as we need the chole to be semi thick, it’s the ideal substitute for water as its full of flavour, colour & protein.  
Further cook it for 15-20 minutes, add more of ginger juliennes & fresh coriander, but if you would like that intense dark colour, cook it for more longer in iron wok until you get your desired colour, do not cook for more than 35-40 minutes or the chole will turn too mushy. Check for the seasoning & add salt as required.

For khatte chatpate aloo
Ingredients:
Raw Potatoes 4-5 medium size (cube)
Oil for frying

Pindi Chana masala 1 tbsp

• Serve hot with hot bhakri and some onions, green chillies, thecha / kharda and some matka dahi. 

For bhakri 
Ingredients:
• Jowar flour 2 cups
• Salt to taste
• Warm Water as required
Methods:
• In a mixing bowl add jowar flour and salt mix well and add warm water as required to knead a soft and moist dough. 
• No need to rest the dough like we rest other dough, you can directly start to shape the without resting.
• Divide the dough in small equal dough balls, sprinkle some dry jowar flour over the dough balls and flatten with hands and start to shape them in traditional way with hands by stretching it with your fingers and rotating it, I tried doing it but its not that easy as it looks, but still am trying, if you're not able to shape it with hands then you can use a rolling pin and shape it like a roti, sprinkle some flour when it sticks to the rolling pin. Do not keep the bhakri to thick or too thin. 
• Once shaped, cook it on hot tawa and sprinkle some water over it, as the water dries flip and cook on other side as well until brown spots appear, cook it open flame, your hot bhakri’s are ready, pour some ghee over hot bhakri and serve it with hot pithala.

Green chillies 3-4 nos. (slit)
Freshly prepared Garam masala 1.5-2 tbsp
Kasuri methi 2 tsp
Lemon juice 1 tbsp
Fresh coriander leaves 4 tbsp (chopped)
Methods:
Add salt to the mutton and mix it well to coat every single piece, keep it aside until you use the mutton for cooking. The minimum time of marination should be an hour.
Set a deep and heavy base vessel on medium heat, add oil and ghee allow the ghee to melt.
Further add sliced onions, cook the onions on medium low heat until they turn golden brown, while keep stirring in short interval, do not keep the flame at high heat. This process may take about 30-35 minutes (if your taking half the quantity it may take less time for onions to brown). If you feel like the onions are sticking to the pan you can little hot water and continue to brown them. The browning of onion is very important so please do not be in a hurry.
While the onions are cooking you can make the fresh ginger garlic chilli paste, add the green chillies, garlic and ginger in a food processor or a grinder and grind it coarsely. Keep aside to be used later.
Once the onions are browned, add the freshly prepared ginger garlic paste, lower the flame and cook for 7-8 minutes.
Further keeping the flame on low heat, add the turmeric powder and cook for 1-2 minutes, further add coriander powder, spicy red chilli powder, Kashmiri red chilli powder and jeera powder, stir and cook well, add 500 ml hot water to avoid the masalas from burning. Continue to cook in low heat until ghee/oil separates.
Once the ghee/oil separates, increase the flame to medium high heat, add the tomatoes and salt to taste, cook until the tomatoes are mushy, keep stirring in every short interval while cooking, once the tomatoes have completely disintegrated add 500 ml hot water and cook until the ghee/oil separates.
Add the salt marinated mutton to the vessel, mix and cook it on medium low heat, stir in short intervals to avoid the mutton and masala from sticking. Cook until mutton leaves its own water and until ghee/oil separates from the masala. 
Slow down the flame to low heat and from now onwards keep the flame to low heat, throughout the cooking process. Do not add any water until mutton release it own water and the ghee/oil separated from the masala.
Once the ghee/oil separates from the masala, add 1 - 1.5 litre hot water and 1-2 tbsp ghee, mix well and bring it to a boil. You can adjust the quantity of water depending on how thick or thin you want your mutton curry to be.
Cover the vessel with the lid and continue to cook on low heat until the ghee/oil separates and the mutton pieces are cooked and tender from inside, stir and cook in every short interval so the masala doesn’t stick to the bottom of the vessel. The cooking of mutton may take about 45-50 minutes or even longer depending on the size and the quality of the mutton. 
Check whether the mutton is tender by taking a piece and cutting it, if it cuts easily you mutton is cooked, and by now the ghee/oil has also separated, so now, add, slit green chillies, ginger juliennes and freshly prepared garam masala, mix gently and cook it for 10-12 minutes, do not cover the vessel.
Add kasuri methi, lemon juice, stir & cook for another 2-3 minutes by mixing gently, check for the seasoning, finish it by adding freshly chopped coriander leaves. 
Your mutton masala is ready, serve it hot with chapati, naan pav or any Indian bread of your choice, you also pair it with some rice and some lemons, onion wedges and some green chillies on the side.
If the mutton is still left, which is a rare case after considering that it is such a delicious dish, you can store it in clean container in the fridge and reheat on a pan and have it next day, the flavour will be much better than the previous day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq1MzP0RKIY

Restaurant Style Tomato Soup | रेस्टोरेंट स्टाइल टमाटर सूप | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full Written Recipe for Restaurant Style Tomato Soup

As this soup is healthy enough to fulfil your nutrition requirements on daily basis, but if you choose to make a little healthier version you can be generous enough to add other veggies like amla, bottle gourd, and may also increase the amount of carrot and beet, and can also choose to add few chicken pieces, to make your soup healthier and more nutritious.
Also I have not used a pressure cooker as I do not prefer cooking this soup in the cooker. It just fades the color and also a skunky smell adds up to the soup. Also I have not used a mixer grinder to grind the pulp, you can use a mixer grinder to escalate the process. CHeers! 
 
Ingredients:
• Butter 2 tbsp

• Black peppercorns 8-9 nos.

• Add the diced beetroot, carrot, coriander stems and Kashmiri red chilli powder, sauté it for 1-2 minutes.
• Add the tomatoes, salt to taste, sugar and jeera powder, mix well and continue to cook on medium high flame, while stirring in every short interval so that the tomatoes don’t burn and they start to disintegrate quickly. This process of disintegrating may take 15-20 minutes, depending on your gas range pressure.  
• By now the tomatoes have cooked well, make sure you mash them with the ladle or the spoon while your stirring. 
Tip: do not cover it with a lid while cooking as it may start to discolour and might leave an off smell.

Add lemon juice and check for the seasoning.
• Your healthy tomato soup is ready. I personally like to consume the soup at this stage, but if you want your soup to be little thick, you can reduce on the water and add the cornstarch & water mixture.
• To make the soup little thick, mix water and cornstarch in a bowl and add the mixture to the soup, when it boiling, stir while adding the cornstarch mixture. Check for the seasoning. Your soup is ready.

Schezwan Chutney Recipe | Desi Schezwan Sauce | शेजवान चटनी | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full Written Recipe for Schezwan chutney

Ingredients:
• Whole Kashmiri red chillies 100 gm
• Oil 1 cup
• Star anise 1 no.
• Garlic 1/3rd cup (chopped)
• Ginger 4 tbsp (chopped)
• Green chillies 3 tbsp as per taste
• Celery stems 3 tbsp (chopped)
• Tomato ketchup 3/4th cup
• Red chilli sauce 5 tbsp
• Light Soy sauce 1 tsp
• Vinegar 2 tbsp
• Salt 2.5 tsp or salt to taste
• White Pepper powder 1 tsp
• Aromat powder/ MSG (monosodium glutamate) 1 tsp
• Sugar 1/2 tsp
• Sichuan pepper powder / black pepper powder a pinch

Methods:
• Break the stems of the chillies, further cut them from between to remove the seeds comfortably and soak them in water for overnight and then boil them for 5-6 minutes, if you're in hurry and would like to skip the overnight soaking step, you can also choose to boil them for 15-20 minutes until the chilli skin swells and becomes soft and tender.
• Strain the water and cool down to room temperature, further transfer it to a grinding jar and make a coarse paste, without adding water.
• Set a pan or deep wok on medium high heat, add oil and star anise, cook it for a minute or until it releases its aroma.
• Further add garlic and cook on medium flame until light golden brown.
• Further add ginger, green chillies, celery stem and cook for 2-3 minuets on medium high flame, you can also add coriander stems if celery stems are not available. If you want your schezwan chutney to be spicy you can increase the amount of green chillies.
• Add the coarsely grinded red chilli paste and cook it 10-15 minutes on high flame, while stirring continuously. If required cook the chillies for more longer until the oil separates.
• Add ketchup, red chilli sauce, light soy sauce and vinegar, stir and cook for 15-20 minutes on high flame.
• Further add salt, white pepper powder, aromat powder, sugar and Sichuan pepper powder cook for 4-5 minutes on medium high flame and the colour darkens a bit more. You can choose to add msg (monosodium glutamate) instant of aromat powder or skip both, it totally depends on your preference and you can also choose to use freshly grounded black pepper if you do not get Sichuan pepper.
• The oil must have separated by now, if not keep on cooking while stirring to avoid it from sticking and burning.
• Cool down the chutney completely before storing, store it in well sterilized jar that is dipped in hot water and dried completely. 
• you're schezwan chutney is ready use accordingly.


Tips for cooking time: The timing I’ve mentioned is based on the gas pressure of my gas burner pressure and also considering other domestic gas burner, you can increase or decrease the cooking time as per your gas burner, at the end the texture of the chutney should be jammy and the oil has to be totally separated from the chutney and the colour will darken compared to the colour we started.

• Tips for maintaining the shelf life: 
1. Make sure the jar that you store it should either be glass or good quality plastic, and it should be sterilized and dried completely.
2. Cool down the sauce before storing in the jar.
3. Always use a clean spoon to remove the desired amount of chutney and refrigerate It back, do not use a bad, wet or a used spoon to remove the chutney.
4. Keep it refrigerated and do not deep freeze it.
5. Make sure there is a layer of oil over the chutney which helps to maintain its shelf live.

Cheese Garlic Naan with Cheesy Dip Recipe | Garlic bread stick style Naan | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Full Written Recipe - Cheese Garlic Naan with Cheesy Dip
Ingredients:


For the Kulcha Dough:


Refined flour 2 cups 
1/4 tsp salt 
1 tsp sugar 
1/2 tsp baking soda 
1/4 cup dahi 
Water as required to knead a soft & super stretchy dough 


Method:


• In a mixing bowl add the dry ingredients & give them a mix. Now add in the curd & add the water gradually. Add water & mix until you have got a sticky mixture & the flour comes together. 
• Now add some oil & start kneading the dough. As soon as you add the oil you will notice that the dough is easier to handle. You can sprinkle some dry flour if the dough is very sticky. 
• Knead well for 10-12 minutes at least or until the dough is smooth & isn’t sticky anymore. 
• Cover with a damp cloth for a minimum of 30 minutes. 


For the cheese garlic filling 


1/4 cup chopped garlic
1/2 cup cheese
1 tbsp fresh coriander
2 tsp green chopped chillies 
A pinch of black pepper powder


Method: 
• In a mixing bowl add all the ingredients & mix well. 
• This filling will be used to fill the naan dough. you can skip this step & only apply the garlic + other ingredients on top of the naan also. 


For oregano seasoning:


Ingredients:
• Garlic powder/Granules 4 tbsp
• Dried Oregano 1 ½ tbsp
• Dried Basil 1 tbsp
• Black pepper powder 1 tsp
• Red chilli powder 1 tbsp
• Dried Rosemary 1 tsp
• Salt to taste


Method:
• This is the seasoning we all crave for to add loads of it on top of pizzas & garlic bread sticks from some famous pizza chains. 
• I didi not have garlic grabules in stock in my kitchen so I used garlic powder, but if you want the perfect results add some garlic granules, it’s simply dry garlic ground coarsely. 
• Add all ingredients & mix well. Rosemary is optional so you could skip that ingredient if you do not have it and you don’t require to buy it if you do not use it frequebtly. 
• Buy some dry basil because you can add it in many other recipes too & it gives a really good flavour. 
• Stire it in an air tight container for months in the fridge.


For assembly: 
Red chilli flakes
Chopped garlic Lots of it 
Fresh coriander 
Ghee 


Method to make the naans:


• Once the dough has rested, make smooth dough balls. 
• Now flatten the dough ball & shape it into a katori. 
• Fill wholesome cheese & garlic filling into the naan dough ball & seal it. You can remove some extra dough if any. 
• Now apply dry flour & flatten it. Use a rolling pin to roll out a thick disk. 
• Now apply very little ghee on top. Now add the chopped garlic, oregano seasoning, red chilli flakes, fresh coriander. 
• Apply some water to your fingers & start pressing the naan to shape it. Remember to roll out a semi thick naan, the naan should not be too thick or too thin. 
• Once the naan is rolled out, stretch from one side to form the elongated naan shape. 
• Set a iron tava on high flame. Note that the tava should be an iron tava. The tava should be really hot. 
• Now apply water nicely on the back of the naan. Stick the naan on the hot tava water side down. 
• Cook until bubbles appear which should take half a minute. Now invert the tava & cook on direct flame while directing the tava from different angles to cook the naan well. 
• Once the naan is cooked perfectly, remove & serve.


For cheesy dip: 


Cheese 250 grams 
Milk 50 – 100 ml
Butter


• To make pizza chains like cheesy dip. Set some water to boil in a vessel. Place a bowl on top to form a double boiler. 
• Now add in the cheese, butter & some milk. Start whisking and let the cheese melt. 
• You should add the milk gradually & depending upon the cheese quality & the area you live in the milk quantity would differ. 
• Once the cheese has melted completely & the cheesy dip has its thick consistency you can now serve it. You can store it in the fridge but the dip tends to solidify a bit. You can run it in the microwave oven for a few seconds and you are good to go. Also, if you have a microwave oven, you can avoid the double boiler method & give 30 second heat waves and mix until you achieve the right consistency to make the dip. 
• Enjoy the dip, you can also flavour it as per your taste with jalapeno or herbs. 
• Enjoy the garlic breadstick with cheesy dip style Naan!

Tip: as you add the water, you’ll feel like it’s too much, but just hold on! Don’t give up! Just knead well and the dough will start to form. 
Add oil and knead the dough once again to make it smooth and stretchy. 
Apply some oil on the dough nicely to prevent the dough from drying and further cover it with a damp cloth and rest it for at least 30 minutes, after 30 minutes you’ll find the dough has risen a bit, knead the dough once again after the rest. 
Sprinkle some dry flour over the dough and divide it into small and equal size dough balls.
Coat it with dry flour, flatten it with hands and further use a rolling pin to make a thick roti,
Set a tawa on medium heat, add little oil, cook the roti briefly on both the sides for roughly 20-30 seconds on each side. Make sure the tawa is hot enough and please do not burn the roti. 
Cook as many half roti as you want and stack them, keep it cover in a cloth or you can also keep them in an insulated casserole to keep them soft.
Use them as required when about to make the frankie.

Ingredients:
Kashmiri red chilli powder 3 tbsp
Turmeric powder 1 tsp

Black salt 1 tbsp
Anardana powder 1 tbsp (optional)
Aamchur powder 3 tbsp

Green chillies 3-4 nos.
Ginger ½ inch

Next, sprinkle some frankie masala all over the roti, top it with some chopped onions, frankie special tangy chutney, some chilli vinegar and sprinkle some more frankie masala for that extra punch, and roll it. Your Mumbai style veg frankie is ready to be served, serve it immediately. 
You can tweak the toppings according to your preference, if you want you can avoid the addition of the onions, if you don’t like them.
I’ve made four variants, just by adding schezwan sauce in one and just cheese in another one and schezwan sauce & cheese in my favorite version. You too can be creative in your own way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCWN9k0LpIY

Mumbai Style Sandwich Recipe | Sandwich Masala | Sandwich Chutney | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Written Recipe for Mumbai Street Sandwich

For making special spicy sandwich chutney
Ingredients:
• Fresh Coriander leaves 1 big bunch
• Fresh Spinach 6-7 leaves (blanched)
• Green chillies 10-12 nos.
• Sandwich masala 1 tsp / to taste
• Garlic 4-5 cloves
• Roasted chana dal 1 tbsp
• Fresh Curry leaves 10-12 nos.
• Water very little 
Methods:
• Wash the coriander leaves well and transfer it to the grinding jar, you can also choose to use coriander stems as they too are full of flavours, add blanched spinach leaves, green chillies, garlic, curry leaves and roasted chana dal, grind well into a fine paste, adjust the consistency by adding water, but use as less water as possible.
• Make sure the chutney should be thick enough to apply on the bread. Your chutney is ready to be used as a spread on your sandwich, you can also store it in an airtight container and refrigerate it for couple of days.
• You must have noticed the quantity of chillies used is too much for making this special spicy sandwich chutney, but this gives the special character to the sandwich, reason being, there’s lot of moisture in the chutney so the chefs and the street vendors just apply it little bit so the sandwich gets its spicy taste and they don’t have to apply too much which apparently makes the bread soggy. 
Tip: street vendors use breadcrumbs to thicken the chutney, but as we are making this back at home chana dal is a perfect substitute to thicken the chutney. If you wish to add breads to it, you can add one bread slice to make it thick. 

Special sandwich masala
Ingredients:
• Whole spices
1. Jeera (cumin seeds) 2 tbsp
2. Cloves 2 tsp
3. Peppercorns 1 tbsp
4. Fennel seeds 1 tbsp
• Powdered spices
1. Amchur powder 1 tbsp
2. Anardana powder 1 tbsp
3. Ginger powder ½ tsp 
4. Hing ½ tsp
5. Black salt 1 tbsp
• Salt 2.5 tbsp
Methods:
• Set a pan on medium heat, add the whole spice and anardana powder, dry roast them until fragrant, take it off from the gas and allow it to cool down. 
• Transfer the roasted spices to a grinding jar, further add the powdered spices and salt, grind it well into a fine powder.
• Your special sandwich masala is ready, use it accordingly and store it in an airtight container in a cool and dry place. 
• Please do make this masala to give your sandwich it’s distinct flavour, as the vegetables are bland in taste and this special sandwich masala has more of salt content which balances the flavour, if you do not wish to stretch the process of making this you can simply add 2 parts of chaat masala and 1 part of salt, this will do the work.

Assembly of sandwich
Ingredients:
• Bread slices as required
• Special spicy sandwich chutney as required
• Soften butter as required (kept outside for couple of hours)
• Special sandwich masala as required
• Vegetables:
1. Potatoes (boiled & sliced)
2. Beetroot (boiled & sliced)
3. Onions (sliced) 
4. Tomatoes (sliced)
5. Cucumber (sliced)
Methods:
• Take 2 sandwich bread slice, you can prefer any sandwich bread, it could be brown bread, multigrain bread, I’ll be using a white sandwich bread, as I’m making it pure Bombay street style sandwich, so we’ll start by trimming of the corners & edges on all four sides and apply sufficient amount of butter and then apply chutney on it, do not apply the chutney first as the bread will become soggy.
• Place the sliced vegetables and sprinkle a pinch of special sandwich masala after every slice or may at the last as you preference.
• Place another bread slice that we applied butter & chutney and close it to make a sandwich, cut into 2 pieces, or 4 or 6, you cut in triangle or squares as you prefer, but again this is pure Bombay street style sandwich so ill cut in six pieces. 
• Spread little butter on top and some chutney to give the look and feel of street style sandwich Serve it immediately.
• You can also choose to toast them by tweaking it a little bit, you don’t need to trim the edges and instead of cucumber you can choose to add capsicum or tweak the addition of veggies according to your taste preference, the assembly of sandwich remains the same.
• Toast the sandwich in the street style toaster or you can also toast them on pan by applying butter. Toast it on both the sides until crisp and golden brown. Toast as many as you wish to.
• Your sandwich is ready, cut into your preferred shape and serve immediately by apply little butter and serve with ketchup, green chutney or any dip of your choice.

Cooking time: 10 mins
Serves: 4-6


Ingredients: 
 Processed cheese 250 gm (grated)
 Potatoes 1 cup (boiled and mashed)
 Corn (boiled) 3/4th cup
 Salt & black pepper to taste
 For slurry:
 Maida (refined flour) ½ cup
 Corn flour ½ cup
 Salt & black pepper to taste
 Water as required
 Bread crumbs for coating as required
 Oil for frying


Methods:
 Take a big size mixing bowl, add the grated processed cheese, nicely mashed potatoes, corn and salt & black pepper to taste, mix and combine well with spatula or you can also use your clean hands to mix the mixture well, make sure the consistency of the potatoes are smooth and not chunky, you can also choose to add a bit of mozzarella or cheddar cheese for the pizza pull.
 When combine the mixture, it should be like dough, transfer the corn cheese mixture to a flat surface or a baking tray, and shape it like a big slab, further cut them into rectangles, or you can choose your favourite shape and shape accordingly.
  Make a slurry by adding maida, corn flour, salt & black pepper to taste and water in a mixing bowl and mix well to make into flowing consistency, adjust the consistency by adding water. Mix well and make sure there are no lumps.
 Dip the corn cheese nuggets in the slurry to coat well and further coat it well with the bread crumbs. Do this method of dipping and coating twice so the cheese doesn’t oozes out while deep frying.
 Dip and coat all the nuggets in the same way and set it in the fridge for 15 minutes before frying. At this stage you can also choose to put them in the zip lock bag and deep freeze, it will last for maximum 1 month. Just thaw it for 15-20 minutes before frying.
 Set a wok or pan filled with oil on medium heat, once the oil is hot, put in the nuggets to deep fry and fry them until they turn crispy and golden brown. Do not over crowd the pan while frying.
 Remove it on an absorbent paper, your crispy cheesy corn nuggets are ready to be served.
 Kids crave for such super cheesy evening snack, serve them hot and crispy along with some ketchup or there any favourite dip. If you would like it cook it other way round, you can also choose to air fry them or bake them in a preheated oven for 15-20 minutes on 180℃. 
 As this recipe was ideated keeping the kids as a priority so I choose to keep it little balance with no spice, but you could definitely add some chopped fresh green chillies or some spices according to your appetite.




For Bread crumbs
Ingredients:
 White bread / brown bread slices
Methods:
 Set a pan on medium heat, add the bread slices and toast the breads on both the sides until golden brown, take it off from the pan and cool down to room temperature.
 Transfer it to a grinder and grind to a fine powder like texture, your fresh homemade bread crumbs are ready to be used, use accordingly.

"Kanda Bhaji recipe | Very Crispy, easy, quick recipe | My Secret Spicy Garlic Chutney | कांदा भजी","Written Recipe for Kanda bhaji 

Prep time: 10 min
Cooking time: 10 min
Serves: 4

For crispy kanda bhajis
Ingredients:
• Onions 6-7 medium size
• Ginger garlic paste 1 tbsp
• Green chillies 3-4 nos. (chopped)
• Fresh coriander leaves 2 tbsp (chopped)
• Red chilli powder 1 tbsp
• Coriander powder 1 tbsp
• Turmeric powder ½ tsp
• Ajwain (carom seeds) 1 tsp 
• Amchur powder (mango powder) 1 tsp
• Garam masala a pinch 
• Lemon juice 1 tsp
• Black salt a pinch
• Salt to taste
• Besan (gram flour) 1 & 3/4th cup
• Corn flour 3/4th cup + 1 tbsp
• Oil for frying
Methods:
• Peel & wash the onions. Now cut them into two halves. Remove the stem of the onion, by doing this the layers of the onion will separate easily. Separate the layers of the onions.
• Now add ginger garlic paste, green chillies, fresh coriander, red chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, ajwain, amchur powder, garam masala & lemon juice. Do not add the salt along with the spices as the onions will start losing a lot of moisture. 
• Mix It really well, by the time  you can set oil in a wok for frying on high heat before doing the next step so that the oil is hot enough by the time the bhaji mixture is ready to be fried. 
• Add a pinch of black salt for that extra kick & salt to taste, mix the mixture well and allow it to rest for just about 2 minutes. Do not squeeze the onion just apply the salt well. This will let us make the bhajis without adding any water. 
• Add the besan and cornflour in three batches, mix the mixture while coating the onions with the flours. The idea is to just coat the onions with the flours & not to make a dipping batter. The quantities of the flours will depend upon the moisture content in your onions so adjust the quantities as required. You can replace the corn flour with rice flour but add half the amount of rice instead of corn flour and increase the besan. 
• The amount of addition of flour depends on the moisture content in the onions, just ensure you coat the onions and not end up making a batter. 
• Dip your fingers in water so the batter doesn’t stick while dropping it in the oil, it is not necessary to shape the bhajji, any random shape will do, but make sure you flatten the mixture lightly and drop them in hot oil.
• The oil should be around 175-185°C, I know that most of us cannot measure it, but make sure the oil should be hot enough, just before you add the bhajis, lower the flame to medium. Once the bhajis are all added and do not touch the bhajis until the outer covering is set. Otherwise the bhajis will disintegrate in the oil. Now increase the flame a little and fry them slowly until crisp & golden brown. 
• Remove on an absorbent paper and serve hot and crispy along with the spicy garlic chutney, you can also pair these up with your favourite dip.

For spicy garlic 
Total time: 10 min
Serves: 4-6
Ingredients:
• Degi red chillies 15 - 20 nos.
• Onions 1/4th cup (sliced)

• Fresh coconut 3/4th cup (grated)
• Black pepper powder a pinch
• Jeera powder (cumin powder) 1 tsp
• Black salt 1/4th tsp
• Salt 1 tsp
• Imli (Tamarind) 1 tbsp 
• Water as required
Methods: 
• Set a pan on medium heat, add the whole red chillies and dry roast it for 2-3 minutes.
• Transfer the roasted chillies to the grinding jar, further add onions, garlic, green chillies, fresh coconut, black pepper powder and salt, jeera powder, black salt and imli, grind to make a fine chutney, and add water as required, make sure the texture is not too runny or too thick.

A pinch of sugar
Cornflour 2 tbsp + water 1 tbsp
Spring onions 3-4 bulbs or you could use onions cut in petals
Capsicum 1/4 cup
Spring onion greens (chopped) for garnish 

Method:


1. We require boiled eggs for this recipe, so hard boil the eggs & cool them down and peel the shell off. 
2. Now cut from the centre to remove the yolk (avoid the yolk for crispy Manchurian balls). Now chop the boiled egg whites & add them into a mixing bowl. 
3. Now add in the sliced onions & all the other ingredients required for making the Manchurian balls. Just do not add the corn starch & refined flour completely. 
4. You will add the flours in batches as we do not want a very doughy texture. 
5. So, if your batter is less moist it will require lesser flour or vice a versa. 
6. Use a spatula or the back of a spoon to mash the mixture lightly to combine really well. 
7. You can also use clean hands to nicely mix the mixture. 
8. You can optionally add some carrots, beans & capsicum as well. What I have noticed during the trials is that the egg flavour completely gets over shadowed. 
9. Now heat some oil in a pan on high heat, once the oil is hot reduce the heat & wait for a couple of minutes. 
10. Now oil your fingers or use a spoon to scoop put small batches of the mixture & roughly shape them into roundels. 
11. Add to the oil and fry on medium low heat until crisp & golden brown. DO not stir for the first minute otherwise the Manchurian balls with disintegrate. 
12. Remove on an absorbent paper until the sauce is prepared. If possible, prepare the sauce simultaneously side by side for better results. 
13. You can also serve the egg Manchurian balls with some schezwan sauce as a quick monsoon snack. I tried some & loved them during the shoot. 


For the sauce:


1. Now set a wok on high heat, once the wok is hot add the oil. 
2. Add in the onion, garlic, ginger & chilli. Cook for a minute on high flame. 
3. Now add in the Spring onion greens, fresh coriander, soy sauce, vinegar, red chilli sauce which is optional & quickly mix. Add in the vegetable stock or water & season with salt, pepper & sugar. Use very less salt, sometimes no salt also works. 
4. Bring the sauce to a boil and prepare some corn starch slurry by mixing 2 parts of corn starch with 1 part of water. 
5. Once the sauce comes to a boil, add the slurry to thicken the sauce, mix continuously until the sauce thickens. 
6. Now add in the spring onion bulbs & capsicum, adding the veggies on a later stage ensures that the veggies stay crunchy. 
7. Do not cook much & lower the flame before you add the Manchurian balls. 
8. Now add the fried egg Manchurian balls & quickly stir. Do not overcook to keep the Manchurian crispy. 
9. Garnish with some chopped spring onion greens. 
10. You can also make egg Manchurian with gravy by increasing the amount of the stock/water and then adjust the flavour with more soy sauce. 
11. Serve immediately. Cheers!

Tandoori Roti on Tava | Garlic Tandoori Roti | Cheese Chilli Garlic Tandoori Roti | Restaurant Style,"Written Recipe

For tandoori roti dough:
• 2 cups whole wheat flour (Gehu ka aata) You can increase or decrease the number of flour as per your requirement. 2 cups i.e 500 grams flour makes 5-6 rotis. 
• ½ tsp salt 
• 2 tbsp oil 
• Water as required (Normal temperature) 

For Garlic Tandoori Roti:
• Chopped garlic as required 
• Kahsmiri red chilli powder as required
• Kasuri methi as required
• Ghee as required 
• Fresh coriander as required 

For Cheese Chilli Garlic Tandoori Roti:
• Processed cheese as required 
• Chopped green chillies as required
• Chopped garlic as required 
• Kahsmiri red chilli powder as required
• Kasuri methi as required
• Ghee as required 
• Fresh coriander as required 

½ cup water + 1 tsp salt mixture for applying on roti. 
Dry flour for dusting
Melted butter as required

Method: 

For tandoori roti dough: 

1. In a mixing bowl add the whole wheat flour, salt, oil & some water and mix. Add the water gradually until the dough comes together. You want to make a semi soft dough and knead it well until the dough turns smooth & a little pale white in color (Basically as you knead the dough the dough will lighten its color) 
2. Now apply some oil on top & rest for a minimum of 30 minutes. 
3. Once the dough has rested, make dough balls, remember the dough balls would be larger than the chapati dough balls we make at home. 
4. One cup flour dough will yield around 3 rotis. 
5. Now you can start making the rotis of your choice. 

6. For Tandoori Roti plain & butter:
7. Set a tava on high heat. Very important to have an iron tava, you should not use a nonstick pan in any case because the roti would not stick on the pan. 
8. Mix some water & salt and set aside. 
9. You want the tava to be really hot before you stick the roti on the pan so before rolling out the dough set the pan on high heat & make sure it is well heated. 
10. Now roll out the roti using some dry flour and you can either use your fingers & palms to make the roti or use a rolling pin. Roll out a semi thick roti. This roti will be thicker than your chapati but would not be as thick as a paratha. 
11. Now apply the salt+water mixture on the back of the roti. Now stick the roti on the really hot tava, the water side would be sticking to the tava. 
12. After sticking the roti to the tava, you should use your finger points to stick the roti onto the tava, ehat did does is that it prevents the roti from fluffing up completely and also gets stuck on the tava really well. 
13. Now let some bubbles appear on the roti. Turn the tava upside down once the bubbles appear. Now keep some distance between the flame & roti and cook the roti on direct flame until brown spots appear and the roti also fluffs a lil bit more. 
14. Once the roti has apt brown spots turn the tava again and remove the roti using a flat spatula. 
15. The roti would have a really nice texture from both the sides just like a roti cooked in a tandoor. 
16. Apply melted butter is you want to serve a butter tandoori roti or you can also serve it as it is. You can cook it a little longer on a lower flame to make some kadak tandoori roti if you like it that way. 

For garlic tandoori roti:
1. Set a pan as explained before. 
2. Now flatten the dough ball a little bit. Apply some dry flour only on one side. 
3. Now apply some ghee on the top side. Add a pinch of Kashmiri red chilli powder & kasuri methi. 
4. Now add the chopped garlic & fresh coriander. 
5. Start flattening the dough ball so that the garlic mixture sticks to the roti really well. 
6. You can now use your fingers & palm or a rolling pin to further roll out of the roti. 
7. You want to roll out a thick roti. 
8. Now apply the salt water on the back side of the roti & cook as mentioned before. 
9. You can serve it with or without butter. 
10. The rotis can be served with any gravies or also with some chutneys & schezwan sauce as an appetizer. 

For chesse chilli garlic tandoori roti. 

• Set a pan as explained before. 
• Now flatten the dough ball a little bit. Apply some dry flour. 
• Now roll out the dough a lil more than before & apply some ghee or oil. 
• Noe add the grated cheese, garlic & chopped chilli. 
• Now fold the roti into a semi-circle. 
• Now apply some ghee again & fold into a triangle. 
• Now apply dry flour on one side. 
• On the top side now add some garlic, chilli, cheese, kasuri methi, Kashmiri red chilli powder & fresh coriander. 
• Now flatten using your fingers & palms. 
• You can use a rolling pin to further roll out the roti. The roti will be triangle shaped. 
• Now apply the salt water on back of the roti & cook as mentioned before. 
• You can serve it with or without butter. 
• The rotis can be served with any gravies or also with some chutneys & schezwan sauce as an appetizer. You can cut it like nachos and serve as an appetizer.

"Mango Ice Cream | 3 ingredient, Creamy, No ice crystals | माँगो आइस क्रीम बनाने का आसान तरीका","Full Written recipe 

Ingredients: 

5-6 Mangoes or 2 cups (approx. 500 grams) 
Condensed Milk ¾ cup (You can add upto 1 cup for added sweetness)
Whipping cream (Sweetened) 1.5 cup (You can use any brand like Amul whipping cream, Richs, Tropilite etc) 
And No Preservatives! 

Some chopped mangoes as required.

If you are using Amul Fresh cream, then you will have to keep an ice bowl below the bowl you will be whisking you cream in. The cream will only whip until soft peaks & you will have to add some powdered sugar. 

Methods:

1. Chop the mangoes as shown in the video or you can also chop as per your convenience. I have removed it from the skin using a spoon which is the most comfortable way for me. Them I just squeeze out the extra pulp from the seeds. 
2. Now add the pulp in a sieve. The excess moisture which will drain out will help reduce the water content in the ice cream which in turn will help us reduce the forming of ice crystals in the ice cream. 
3. Now without using a single drop of water grind the mangoes into a puree.
4. Now in a bowl add 2 cups of mango puree & mix ¾ cup of condensed milk. You can use 1 cup too as per your taste. Mix really well & check for sweetness. If the sweetness is good for you then do not add any sugar. If you want more sweetness you can add in powdered sugar as per your choice and taste to check. 
5. I did not add any sugar because my mixture was perfect & also to remember that the cream we will be using is also already sweetened. The sweetness of mangoes also plays a big role. 
6. Now in another bowl add the whipping cream. Use a whisk or a electric blender to whip the cream until stiff peaks. The whisk will take you about 15 minutes but the electric beater reduces the time drastically,. 
7. If you are using fresh cream you should keep a bowl full of ice and then sprinkle good amount of salt on it. Now keep another bowl in it & then start whisking. I have tried this and with a whisk it takes a good 25 minutes and with the electric beater it almost will take you around 15 minutes. Whipping cream is a much better option & now it is available in many stores near you so please try & use the whipping cream. 
8. Once the cream is whipped now gradually add in the mango mixture. mixing the mixture slowly ensure that the cream does not lose its air which is very important. You can use a cut & fold method to fold in or just simply mix slowly. 
9. Retain ¼ cup of mango mixture for later use. It will be used to make those swirls like premium ice creams have, you can opt to skip this step & mix the complete mixture. 
10. Use a whisk too smoothen out the mixture. 
11. Now use & metal, glass or plastic container to set the ice cream. 
12. Now add in some chopped mangoes and mix gently. Add in the remaining mango mixture & use a bamboo stick or back of the spoon to make swirls as shown. 
13. Cover with a plastic wrap & make sure that it touches the ice cream’s surface. This will ensure that no ice crust is formed on top. I used three containers for this ice cream so it does not matter to use various molds, you can also set it in smaller individual servings. 
14. Freeze you ice cream, for at least 4 hours or overnight. 
15. Remove you ice cream and rest it for 5 minutes before serving. You can serve it with some fresh mangoes. Enjoy some delish mango ice cream with no preservatives!

Paneer Makhani Restaurant Style | Paneer Makhanwala | Butter Paneer | रेस्टोरेंट स्टाइल पनीर मखनी,"Written Recipe

Prep time: 10 mins 
Cooking time: 35 mins 
Serves: 4

For makhani gravy (Base used for any makhani or butter chicken) 

Ingredients:
• Jeera (cumin seeds) 1 tsp
• Green cardamom 3-4 nos.  (Hari elaichi)
• Kashmiri red chillies 1-2 nos. (Optional: Use can increase the powder if not used, I use it for the color)
• Garlic cloves 5-6 nos.
• Ginger ½ inch 
• Onion 1 medium size (roughly sliced)
• Tomatoes 4-5 medium size (roughly chopped)
• Coriander powder 1 tsp
• Cashew nuts 10-12 nos.
• Turmeric powder 1/4th tsp
• Salt to taste
• Water 200-300 ml
• Garam masala ½ tsp
• Butter 1 tbsp
Methods:
• Set a pan or a wok on medium heat, add jeera, green cardamom, Kashmiri red chillies, ginger, garlic cloves, onions, tomatoes, coriander powder, cashew nuts, turmeric powder, salt, and water, Add garam masala and butter, mix well, cover and cook for 15 minutes on medium heat. Stir in intervals to prevent it from sticking and burning. (Usually you can just leave it alone, the water prevents it sticking)
• Cool down to room temperature and transfer the mixture to the grinding jar, grind into a fine paste. Your Makhani gravy base is ready it can used in making butter chicken, makhani pasta or any dish that you would like to be creative with. 

For paneer makhani 
Ingredients:
• Butter 1 tbsp + oil 1 tsp
• Jeera (cumin seeds) 1 tsp
• Ginger 1 inch (julienne)
• Green chillies 1-2 nos. (chopped/sliced)
• Paneer 350 gm (cubes)
• Salt a pinch
• Kashmiri red chilli powder 1 tsp
•  Honey/ sugar 1 tbsp (optional)
• Kasuri methi 1 tsp (toasted)
• Fresh cream 1 tbsp
• Butter 1 tsp (optional)
• Fresh coriander 1 tbsp (chopped)
Methods:
• Set a pan or wok on medium heat, add butter & oil, jeera, ginger, and green chillies, mix well and sauté it for a minute.
• Add paneer cubes to the same wok/pan, sprinkle some salt to taste and lightly fry the paneer from all sides until light golden brown.
• Remove the paneer from the pan and keep aside, in the same pan add the Kashmiri red chilli powder and bleed out the colour by mixing it. DO not cook it further as the chilli powder will burn otherwise, remember to keep the flame really low. 
• Next, strain the makhani gravy using a sieve and add to the wok/pan, mix, and cook for 2-3 minutes. A lot of you think that there is a lot of wastage but if you grind it very fine there would not be any wastage. 
• Adjust the gravy consistency by adding water if it becomes too thick, cook for 2-3 minutes.
• Further add the lightly fried paneer cubes to the gravy and mix gently. 
• Next, if you want to balance the taste of sour and sweet you can go ahead and add honey or sugar depending on your consumption, adding of any sweetener is totally optional, if your more likely to have a spicy palate you can simply skip it. The makhani gravy I make is not really sweet, eben addition of 1 tbsp of sugar or honey does not make it sweet but balances the taste. If you like the sweet version skip the whole Kashmiri chillies completely & increase the sugar/honey quantity.
• Add some lightly toasted kasuri methi, just rub it between your clean and dry palms before adding it.
• Add a pinch of garam masala and salt to taste, mix gently and cook it for 2-3 minutes. Now lower or switch of the flame before adding the cream, otherwise the cream will split and leave the ghee. 
• Add fresh cream, if you don’t have market ready fresh cream then you can add fresh home cream. Stir gently and mix well.
• Add a blob butter if you want to finish it with some more richness, we have added very less butter overall for a serving of 4 persons restaurants add in a lot, if you're health conscious you're allowed to skip it completely in the intial stages and add it just over here for the added flavour. 
• Add some freshly chopped coriander leaves and mix well, your restaurant style paneer makhani is ready to be served, serve hot with butter naan, butter paratha or any Indian bread or roti of your choice. Garnish it by pouring a dash of fresh cream before serving in the bowl.
To Note: I have not added a lot of whole spices in the initial gravy because I have used the powdered garam masala. You have an option too add whole dalchini, tez patta, kaali mirch, moti elaichi & cloves (Laung) to the Makhani base. You will have to discard the spices before grinding. I use powdered spices as the flavor is then controllable & its also more convenient. That’s the way I like it. Enjoy!

Street Style Egg Tava Pulao | Easy Anda Recipe | फटाफट बनाइये अंडा तवा पुलाओ | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Egg recipes are always a hit amongst egg-eatarians, I have always got immense love for my egg recipes & here is another one which is a really quick and a street style version of the egg tava pulao. I wanted to make a quick version that is why I did not use garlic & Kashmiri red chilli paste in this pulao, otherwise that would do wonders to this recipe. I will leave that tweak in the recipe below if you want to add that flavour to the pulao. This is also an awesome recipe for monsoons. Enjoy this easy pulao recipe soon!


Street Style Egg Tava Pulao Written recipe: 


Ingredients
3 Boiled eggs (Diced) 
For scrambled eggs:
1 tbsp desi ghee
3 eggs
Salt to taste
A pinch of black pepper


For tava pulao 
Cooked Basmati Rice 3 cups- If you are not using leftover or cooked rice, cook the rice using boiling method, 1-1.5 cups of rice should be more than enough. Keep the rice in the fridge for at least 2-3 hours our overnight, you can use instantly cooked rice but the pulao would be a lil sticky. 
1 tbsp desi ghee
1 tsp jeera (Cumin) 
1 tbsp ginger garlic paste 
2-3 green chillies (As per spiciness) 
1 medium sized onion or half cup (Sliced)
1 capsicum or half cup 
2-3 Nos. or ¾ cup tomatoes
1 tsp turmeric powder
1 tbsp red chilli powder (Use Kashmiri for good color and less spicy)
2 tsp coriander powder (Dhaniya powder)
salt to taste 
A pinch of black pepper
50 ml water or as required
2 tbsp + 1 tbsp fresh coriander (Dhaniya)
1 tsp lemon juice
A pinch of garam masala 


Method:


1. You require boiled eggs for this recipe, so hard boil 3 eggs & remove the shell.
2. Dice the boiled eggs and set aside.
3. Now break three eggs into a mixing bowl and add salt & pepper too taste. Whisk the eggs using a fork. 
4. Now set a pan on medium heat and add some ghee/oil. Now pour the whisked eggs & cook for a few minutes. Scramble the eggs, you do not want to make an omelette. Set aside
5. You can use a pan/tava or you can use a kadhai if you are comfortable in using a kadhai, the tava surely brings out a different texture. 
6. In the same pan add some ghee & add jeera, green chillies ginger garlic paste, onions & capsicum. Cook for 1-2 minutes. 
7. Now add in the tomatoes along with salt, red chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder & black pepper. Cook for 2-3 minutes, now start mashing the veggies roughly with the spatula. Now add in some water so that you can cook the veggies properly and get some moisture in the masala. 
8. Now add in the diced boiled eggs and cook for a minute so that the boiled eggs get some flavour.
9. Now add in the cooked basmati rice which is cooled down well, cooled down rice always would make a nice tava pulao,  just like a fried rice. 
10. Add in the scrambled eggs, 2 tbsp of the fresh coriander (I use the coriander stems as well for the added flavour), now mix & cook for 2-3 minutes. 
11. Now add in lemon juice, garam masala which is optional and some fresh coriander. You can add more fresh coriander, I just love the freshness of coriander in this recipe. 
12. Mix & serve it hot. 
13. For those who would want to know that how the pulao has some white rice on top, I added some boiled white rice just a spoon which I had kept aside too cut the color of the pulao just for presentation purposes. 
14. Serve with red garlic chutney, onions & lemon. 
15. Enjoy this street style recipe! 


Optional Kashmiri paste option. 


Take 3-4 Kashmiri red chillies and soak them in hot water for 10 minutes, Grind the chillies along with 4-5 garlic cloves and grind it into a fine paste using some water. Add it instead of the ginger garlic paste & red chilli powder in the recipe. Enjoy!

Homemade Mango Jam full written recipe

Ingredients:

Alphonso mangoes 6-7 or 750 grams of pulp (You can use any sweet mango of your choice)
Sugar 250 grams 
a pinch of salt 
1 tbsp lemon juice 

Method:

• Wash the mangoes really well and wipe them dry. 
• Now you require chopped mangoes for the jam, so you can do it how you are comfortable or use my method to do it. Cut of the sides and make cuts using a knife. Now use a spoon to remove the chopped mango from the skin. 
• Now peel the seeds & squeeze out the mango pulp. This combination of mango pulp and chopped mangoes gives a really good texture to the jam as well. You require 1:3 ratio of sugar to mango after you have skinned the mango. So, you can adjust quantities as required.
• You can also grind the mango into a puree using a mixer grinder, but I do not advise it as the texture of chopped and cooked mangoes is much much better. 
• Now in a pan, preferably a nonstick pan, add the mangoes, sugar, a pinch of salt and some lemon juice or vinegar. The salt and lemon will bring out the flavors and also will help to preserve the jam. 
• Now start cooking on medium flame, you need to stir it regularly, in fact almost all the while. The cooking process will melt and cook the sugar as well as the mangoes will break down. 
• Once the sugar has melted and starts boiling, the jam will start to splutter, use a lid or plate to stay safe and also adjust the heat accordingly. 
• After 30 minutes of cooking check the jam for its readiness. Take a plate and add one spoon of jam on the plate. Let it cook for 30 seconds and then tilt the plate, the jam should not drip. Once its set you can stop cooking, if not then continue cooking and check again. 
• I like to keep the jam a bit runny when it’s hot, a lot of people cook until its completely dry and then the jam consistency is too thick as it thickens as it cools down. 
• Sterilize a glass jar simultaneously by adding an opened glass jar, lid, spoon to add the jam and spatula into boiling water. Remember that the glass jar should be heat proof. After a couple of minutes remove everything and rest for a minute so that the steam escapes from the jar and its dry. 
• Add the jam into it, the jam does not need to be cooled down. Once the jam is added into the jar and is cooled down close the lid. 
• Now you can also re-dip it again in the boiling water to increase its shelf life. I usually have stored it for over 6 months in the fridge but if all the sterilization is done well then you can easily store this for a year. 
• Keep the jam always in the fridge for longer, use it on breads, in toppings, in fillings, on desserts etc.

"16 Layers Eggless Mango Crepe Cake | NO OVEN, NO BAKING POWDER | बिना अंडे के माँगो क्रेप केक","Those layers, OMG that looks so good. NO EGGS, NO OVEN, NO BAKING POWDER, 16 layers of crepes layered with some yum mango butter cream. As all of you know that I do not bake a lot and also I cook less desserts comparatively. I just wanted to make a mango cake & not bake it and I prepped this randomly. I started shooting this late night a few days back & it was so much fun prepping this cake. The butter cream frosting is a little too sweet for my taste but if you have a sweet tooth it works really well. If you want to make it less sweet and if you have some whipping cream handy, you can do it the way its done with whipping cream filling. Just whip up some cream & add mango puree into it & layer your cake with the whipping cream filling. The cake will be much lighter & less sweet. Enjoy this cake.

Hey! There is a typo in the title, MANGO IS SPELLED AS MAGNO by mistake. Enjoy the recipe!

*TIP: you can also use wheat flour for a healthier option or half n half, just that the crepes would be a little bit denser. 
• Use 1/4th cup or any measuring cup of your choice depending how big or small you want your crepes to be, fill it with the batter, set a pan on medium heat and pour it over non-stick pan which is 8 inches in diameter, you can adjust the size as per availability but the size of crepes and number of crepes will change accordingly.  Swirl the pan so the batter spreads on the pan evenly, cook the crepes on both the sides until light golden brown in colour. Make sure the crepes are neither too thin nor too thick. Remove it from pan and cool them down.

Kairi & Kanda Bhajiyas – Super Crispy | Raw Mango | क्रिस्पी कैरी कांदा भजिया  | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Raw mangoes are in season are easily available, I just got this idea of what if we cook some bhajiyas out of the amazing kairi. To balance it out I did an onion combination & prepped some super-super crispy bhajiyas which were tangy, sweet, spicy – perfect for my taste. These turn out to be amazing and as the weather is getting humid & it might rain soon, this is a best way to cook some for the first rains. You can reduce or increase the ratio of the raw mangoes to onions as per your taste, I love the half n half ratio. The bhajiyas stayed crispy for hours and we finished them all within minutes after shooting the recipe. 
Try these crispy kairi bhajiyas. 




Written recipe:
Super Crispy Kairi Kanda Bhajiya 


Prep Time: 20 minutes
Cooking Time: 15 minutes
Serves: 4


Ingredients


2 cups Raw mango (Kairi) 
2 cups Onions (Finely sliced) 
2-3 green chillies chopped 
Salt to taste
1 tbsp Red chilli powder
1 tbsp Coriander powder
1/4 tsp Turmeric powder
½ tsp Ajwain
½ tsp Garam masala
1 tsp Jeera powder 
1 tsp Black salt 
Besan 1 cup + as required 
Corn flour/rice flour ¼ cup + as required 
Vegetable oil for frying 


Methods:


• Wash the raw mangoes very well, optionally you can also remove the peel. Now use a box grater or a grater with large holes to grate the raw mangoes. 
• Now slice the onions finely. 
• In a mixing bowl add all the ingredients except the besan & cornstarch/rice flour.
• The salt will help the moisture in the onions & raw mangoes to ooze out which will help the flour to stick around. Use clean hands to squeeze the onions & mangoes for the perfect consistency.
• Now add the besan & corn starch/rice flour. I add it in batches because the moisture content differs in types of mangoes & onions. Remember the batter should not be too much of flour nor too much of veggies. It should be balanced. Mix it well & you can adjust the quantitiy of the flours as required. 
• Rest the mixture for 15 minutes.
• Remember do not use a single drop of water in the batter. 
• Now set a pan or vessel with oil mon medium high flame. 
• Check if the oil is hot by dropping a little of the batter into the oil, it should quickly rise up and bubbles should be around the batter. 
• Now using your fingers take some batter and flatten it so that the bhjiyas are crisp. 
• Once the bhajiyas are added into the oil cook for a minute on medium high heat & then lower the heat. Let the bhajiyas cook slowly, this is the key to make really crisp bhajiyas. Do not rush, let them cook for atleast 7-8 minutes on medium low heat. 
• Once the bhajiyas are crisp & golden in color, remove using a slotted spoon. 
• Transfer on an absorbent paper & serve hot with mint chutney.

Quick Egg Pizza Roll & Thin Crust Egg Pizza with Chapati | चपाती अंडा पिज़्ज़ा रोल ओर पिज़्ज़ा,"This recipe just was a really random thought and while I had the idea for the roll, I actually thought that it can be served as a pizza as well. The roll is healthy and really quick to do. The only difference in between both the styles of serving is that the pizza version is cooked a little longer for the extra crisp in the crust. You can make some quick pizza sauce at home by referring to my recipe linked below. It’s a kids friendly recipe. You can also incorporate some dal or veggies into the chapati and also some hidden veggies in the pizza sauce for your kids. Kids would like the plain cheese version so blend the veggies in the dough and sauce. Enjoy this quick recipe!

Bedmi Puri With Aloo Sabzi Recipe | बेड़मी पूरी और आलू की सब्ज़ी | Chef Sanjyot Keer | #Lockdown,"Bedmi Puri with Aloo Sabzi:
Active prep time: 25 minutes
Idle prep time- 1.5 hours
Cooking time: 20-25 minutes total
Serves: 4

For Bedmi poori:
Dal ki pitthi: (Mixture of dal which will go in the dough)
Urad dal 3/4cup 
Water to saok
½ inch Ginger 
1 Green chilli 
1 tsp  red chilli powder 
1 tsp coriander powder 
½ tsp garam masala 
1 tsp saunf (Fennel)
1 tsp Kasuri methi 
1 tsp salt 

Kneading of the dough:
1 ¾  cups wheat flour
½ cup rava (sooji, semolina)
½ cup Luke warm water
Oil 2 tsp

For aloo ki sabzi:
2 tbsp desi ghee
1 tsp jeera
1 inch ginger (Chopped)
2 green chillies (Chopped & as required)
1 tsp saunf crushed (Fennel seeds)
1 tsp coriander seeds crushed (Sabut dhania)
2 dry red chillies
1 tsp hing (Asafoetida)
1 tsp turmeric powder (haldi)
1 tsp red chilli powder
2 tsp soaked methi seeds (Fenugreek seeds, soaked for 2 hours minimum)
1 tbsp besan (Gram flour) 
5 Boiled potatoes rough mashed
Salt to taste 
Water as required,l I used about 1 lire 
1 tbsp Jaggery/sugar (optional) 
Amchur 1 tsp
Kala namak a pinch (Optional)
Kasuri methi 1 tsp 
Fresh coriander as required & if available in lockdown

Methods:
For Bedmi poori:
1.Bedmi is prepared majorly in two ways which is by either stuffing the pitthi in the dough or by kneading the pitthi along with the dough. I have used the second method because it will be easier for all of you. So let’s make the pitthi. 
2.Wash the urad dal nicely & soak the dal in enough water for 1-2 hours. If you soak it for longer which is 5-6 hours then it is cool. 
3.While soaking the dal also soak the methi seeds which will be using for the aloo (Just a tip)
4.Strain the dal and discard the water. Now use a mixer grinder to grind the dal, add in the ginger, chilli, red chilli powder, coriander powder, garam masala, saunf, Kasuri methi & salt. Use the pulse mode or grind the dal by starting & stopping the grinder briefly so that we get a coarse dal mixture. You can add minimum water to grind the dal if required. Dal ki pitthi is ready.
5.Now in a mixing bowl or on a kitchen platform add the wheat flour, rava, dal ki pitthi, oil & start mixing. Use luke warm water to knead a stiff dough. Add the water gradually so that you do not add excess water into the dough. 
6.You can also add some oil or ghee into the flour earlier to add some moin into the dough for extra flakiness, it is completely up to you, I added the oil later which worked perfectly well. 
7.Once the dough comes together, knead it for 3-4 minutes & apply some oil on top of the dough. Cover with a damp cloth and rest the dough for 30 minutes.
8.After 30 minutes, set a wok or kadhai on high flame & heat some oil. You do not need a lot of oil, just 1-1.5 inches from the bottom of the kadhai is enough.
9.Now shape some dough roundels for the bedmi, use a rolling pin to roll out thick puris. The puri just be just a little thicker than normal puris. You can use some oil if the dough is sticking to the rolling pin or the platform. 
10.Once the oil is hot , reduce the flame a little and test the oil by adding a small piece of dough into the oil, the dough should immediately rise up & oil should be bubbling around the dough. 
11.Now add in the rolled puri & just give it 5 seconds to coat with oil. Now using your spatula start gentle pushing in inside the oil, this will allow the puri to fluff up immediately. 
12.Once the puri fluffs up, flip and cook from the other side. If the puri is not coloured properly you can use the spatula to sprinkle some oil on the top to cook evenly. Fry the puri until it is crisp & golden brown. Strain the puri & leave it on a wire rack or absorbent paper to remove excess oil. Repeat until puris are fried & served. 

For aloo ki sabzi:
1.You need boiled potatoes for this recipe, so you can boil the potatoes by pressure cooking them for 2-3 whistles in a pressure cooker or boil until done. 
2.Set a kadhai on medium heat and add some desi ghee, you can use oil too. 
3.Now add in the 1 tsp jeera, ginger (Chopped), green chillies (Chopped & as required), crushed saunf  (Fennel seeds), crushed coriander seeds  (Sabut dhania), dry red chillies & sauté for a minute. Do not over burn the spices.
4.Now add in the hing (Asafoetida), turmeric powder (haldi), red chilli powder, soaked methi which we had soaked earlier, besan (Gram flour) & cook for half a minute. 
5.Now roughly crush or mash the potatoes with your hands and add it in, this is key to the texture. Just be as rough as possible. 
6.Add the water, I used 1 litre because the sabzi thicken if we do not serve immediately. You can adjust as required.
7.Add salt to taste, add a lil less as we will add some black salt in the end which is optional.
8.Cook for 8-10 minutes on medium flame. 
9.Now add in the aamchur powder, kasuri methi, black salt and cook for 2 minutes.
11.Add some fresh coriander & garnish with some ginger juliennes & fresh coriander & serve the delicious aloo ki sabzi with the crisp bedmi hot!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmSqWQSGPl0

3. Set a pan on medium heat and add oil in the pan. Now add in the grated ginger, sauté for a minute. Now add in the coarsely ground spice mix & roast the spices for a minute. 
4. Now add in the boiled potatoes, salt to taste, black pepper powder & ajwain. Give it a nice mix. Now add in the Boiled green peas, if you do not want to boil the green peas then add the green peas before only, I had some boiled green peas that’s why I added the boiled ones. You can also choose not to add in the green peas. 
5. I have added green chilli paste, you can add in chopped green chillies while adding the ginger.
6. Now cook the potatoes by not stirring for 3-4 minutes just stir for once or twice. 
7. Now stir and mash the potatoes roughly, you want some bits & pieces of potatoes along with the mashed potatoes.

19. Fry until crisp & golden brown. 
20. Serve the quick bread samosas with some chutneys, ketchup or schezwan sauce. 


Home-Made breadcrumbs:


To ensure that we are not wasting any of that bread in this lockdown. We will use it to make some quick home-made breadcrumbs. 


1. Toast the bread on medium heat in a pan or in an oven. 
2. Once the bread is crisp, let the bread cool down. 
3. Use a mixer grinder or a chopper to grind the toasted bread into breadcrumbs. 
4. Store in an air-tight container & keep it in the freezer for up to a month. 
5. Use it for coating your burger patties, or kababs etc.

Omelette Makhani Curry Recipe | Chef Sanjyot Keer | #Lockdown #Stayhome #Withme,"Written recipe in the description box.

This is my quick version of an egg omelette curry with a quick makhani curry twist. So omelette curry also can be made with an onion-tomato gravy base but this one is very similar to a makhani gravy. This version can be made with minimum ingredients & is super quick to prepare. Like I have been telling in my previous recipes, this lockdown has made me remind many recipes I usually make when I am lazy or I have less ingredients, you can also make the same recipe & add in some paneer, chicken, veggies or boiled eggs as well. I just used the ingredients I had, like I did not have butter, so I used ghee, if you have it please add it, if you do not have cream & milk, add in beaten curd. You can just take the recipe idea & make it yours. You can add some cashews in the puree if you have some, I have not added thinking about majority of you might not have them. Its super simple yet delicious. Try the recipe, I hope you will like it. #StayHome #StaySafe 

Omelette Makhana Curry 
Prep time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes 
Serves- 2-3 persons 

For the omelette:

• 4 Eggs 
• Salt to taste
• A pinch of black pepper 
• ¼ tsp red chilli powder
• 1 tsp green chilli
• 1 tbsp ghee 

For the makhana curry:

• 4 tomatoes 
• 2-3 green chillies 
• 1 inch ginger
• 1 tbsp ghee
• 1 tsp jeera 
• Salt to taste
• ½ tsp sugar
• 1 tbsp Kashmiri red chilli powder
• ½ tsp turmeric powder
• 1 tsp coriander powder
• 2 tbsp tomato ketchup 
• 2 tbsp fresh cream or malai
• 200 ml milk 
• 1 tsp kasuri methi 
• a pinch of garam masala 
• 1 tbsp fresh coriander

Methods:

For the omelette:

1. Break the eggs into a bowl, add seasoning & green chilies is optional. Now whisk really well. You can use a fork or an egg whisk. 
2. Set a pan on medium heat, use a non-stick preferably. Now add some ghee, oil or butter. 
3. Now pour the whisked eggs and let the lower layer cook, if you see a lot of uncooked egg on the top, just pull some cooked egg to make space on the pan and tilt your pan to fill that space with the uncooked egg. This will help in even cooking of the omelette. 
4. Now let the omelette set in the pan and flip once set. 
5. Cook on the other side & transfer the egg to a plate or a board. 
6. Now roll the omelette & cut into 1 cm strips. 
7. Your omelette strips are ready. 


For the makhani curry:

1. Cut the tomatoes into quarters roughly, add the tomatoes, green chillies & peeled ginger into a mixer grinder. Make a fine puree. 
2. Now set a pan (use the same pans used for the eggs, less washing) on medium heat. 
3. Add some ghee, due to the lockdown I did not have butter & I was really lazy to make white butter. The whole idea of this recipe is to make the makhni curry for the egg curry in a hurry with basic ingredients. If you have the butter do add a dollop of butter. 
4. Add some jeera & let it crackle. 
5. Now add in the tomato puree, salt, sugar & mix.
6. Now add in tomato ketchup, red chilli powder, use some Kashmiri red chilli if you have, it really gives a good color. Add the coriander powder & turmeric powder & cook for 7-8 minutes. 
7. You just need to remove the rawness of the tomatoes. 
8. Now lower the flame & in a bowl mix some fresh cream or malai with milk. Add the mixture & stir well. You can just only add milk if you do not have fresh cream (And yes you can add the malai which sets on top of the milk you boil at home. You can also switch cream & milk with beaten curd as well, use half cup of curd, whisk it well & add some water later to adjust the consistency. 
9. Cook for 3-4 minutes & now add in some roasted  Kasuri methi & garam masala. 
10. Add in the omelette strips & stir well. 
11. Just cook for a minute & the curry is ready to serve. 
12. If you want a makhani experience like butter chicken or butter paneer, keep the curry thick. If you want a makhana flavored egg curry experience you can add in more milk or water to have a curry like feel to be had with rice. The choice is yours. 
13. Finish with fresh coriander if you have some, I just had the last bit left. I just lobe fresh coriander.
14. Serve it & garnish with fresh cream. You can garnish it with beaten curd as well.

Home-made Masala Milk | Chef Sanjyot Keer | #Lockdown #StayHome #Withme,"I just got this idea of making some masala milk, I remembered that my really close friend Sajid loves masala milk and he used to come drive for an hour at least twice in a week during Ramadan, he just loves it. I am sure Sajid & a lot of you would not be able to buy masala milk but surely you can enjoy it by preparing some at home. 
Hope you enjoy this new video format, I have been thinking about this format for a long time & had decided that I will start this new format once a week after the lock down, but I could not resist. Was a peaceful & calm day which reflects in the video (I hope). This is soothing for me as I love watching food being cooked while appreciating the beauty & the sounds of cooking. Hope you enjoy it too. Stay home, Stay safe! 
Yes, the older format videos will continue HAHA. #ASMR 

Written recipe:

Masala Milk Recipe with Home-made masala milk powder
Prep time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes 
Makes 750 grams of masala powder

Ingredients:

For the Home-made special masala milk powder:
• Cashew nuts -1/2 cup 
• Almonds-1/2 cup
• Pistachios -1/2 cup
• Black pepper (Crushed)- 1 tsp 
• Grated nutmeg- 1.5 tsp 
• milk powder (optional) -4 tbsp 
• Cardamom- 15-18 Nos. (I remove the covering; you can add whole)
• saffron- 0.5 gram 
• turmeric powder- 1 tsp 

Method:

1. Set a pan on medium heat and dry roast the almonds, pistachios & cashew nuts. 
2. Remove off heat after 3-4 minutes & cool them down. 
3. Now in a mixer grinder add the roasted nuts, saffron, black pepper, grated nutmeg, milk powder, turmeric & milk powder. The milk powder gives the milk the extra creaminess. You could avoid if you do not have it.
4. Now grind using the pulse mode or in very short intervals, you could also do this in batches & make a coarse powder. 
5. The special home-made masala milk is ready!! You can use 3 tbsp for every liter of milk. Store it in a clean airtight container and refrigerate it. Stays good for a month. 

For masala milk hot or cold

• Milk- 2 liters
• Cashew nuts – 7-8 Nos. (For the paste)
• Water ¼ cup (for blanching the cashew nuts)
• Saffron 5-6 strands 
• Sugar – I added 10 tbsp (you could add more or less, or use sativa or sugar free) 
• Slivered nuts of your choice I added 3 tbsp of almonds, cashews & pistachios

Method:

1. Now the secret ingredient for a creamy thick masala milk is cashew nut paste and in most of the shops they add thickening agents like corn flour. We will use cashew nit paste. 
2. Blanch the cashew nuts in water for 4-5 minutes. Cool them down and make a really fine paste. Really fine!
3. Now if you are making hot milk, use the full paste. If you are making chilled milk add half the paste because once the milk is cooled down the milk will thicken a lot. 
4. Now set a large vessel and add the milk. 
5. Bring the milk to a boil and lower the heat. 
6. Now add in the milk masala powder, I used 6 tbsp for 2 liters of milk. 
7. Add in the cashew paste, some extra saffron for the color & flavor. 
8. Add in the sugar, now you can add in the sugar later too because you will know how much you need to add. So, add it after 8-10 minutes. I added everything together in a hurry. 
9. You could use sugar free options too. 
10. Now cook the milk on a low flame for 8-10 minutes while stirring in intervals. In between just add some chopped or slivered nuts for the extra bite. The masala milk is incomplete without the bite in it. 
11. once the milk is cooked for about 8-10 minutes you can serve the milk hot, tastes super in winters.
12. But if you fall into my category, you can chill it. 
13. Let the milk cool down to room temperature & then fill in bottles or just in a container & chill it for a couple of hours serving. 
14. Stays good for 2 days in the fridge not more. 
15. Enjoy the masala milk guys, hope you enjoyed the recipe. Stay home & stay healthy

Small Gestures Do Matter | Chef Sanjyot Keer | #Lockdown #Stayhome,"The last few weeks have been difficult for everyone in different ways, be it daily wage workers or some one who has a good salaried job & a roof for shelter. We had never thought in our wildest dreams that we would be facing a virus which would lock us down in our homes, so many lives lost & many other social & financial issues we would be facing. We were not ready for this, not one was but we have to think positively in these times. For the fortunate ones, I feel blessed to have everything I have, I do not have to worry about a roof being over my head or what would be my next meal? But when I think about so many people who would not have a roof over their heads or their most immediate worry would be that how will they afford or get their next meal, I feel very heavy hearted. For a lot of us our daily routines, our home work outs or cooking something or taking challenges & posting it on social media platforms is what we are thinking about, which is not wrong at all, I too do this, but along with this the world needs us to be more kind, be more considerate & help people around us. Let’s do our bit by doing small things like sharing a portion of our food & daily essentials with people you know would be facing a crisis situation in this difficult time. Think about street animals who would be thirsty & hungry in this scorching heat. Also, in this time while we are facing a lockdown, mental health is of almost importance, call your family, friends & most importantly people who you work with, ask them about their well being, ask them if they need anything or if you could be of any help. Thank your mom, dad, house help because of these people we have never realised that how our homes function so well, we get our clothes pressed on time, our meals on time, in such times we realise how much they have done for us and when we thank them we also should take up some responsibilities off their shoulders.
Doctors, nurses, police men & women, government employees, people working in the essential services, all of these people are fighting for us. It is a difficult time for them & their families too but they are in the battle field fighting for us, let’s do our bit by staying home and help others. I am not telling you to spend a lot of money, or go out of your way to help people but do your bit in the smallest ways possible. I am sure you are already doing your bit. Small gestures do matter. 


*Thank you YFL family, we raised INR 2,00,000 to fight against Covid-19, thank you for being kind. I am sure this will help our corona warriors.
*Thank you to all the corona warriors you are our heroes!
*And yes! We will fight and get through this together

5 Simple Rava Recipes For Lockdown | रवा से बनाइये 5 आसान रेसिपी | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Rava also called as sooji, semolina is a by product of wheat and is a really versatile ingredient. It can be cooked into different recipes be it, chaat, starters, breakfasts snacks, desserts it blends in really well and is really easy to cook. 
Here’s my list of 5 recipes which do not require any fresh produce (chillies, coriander or onions are required for some but can be avoided), in this lockdown I have tried to cook recipes with simple ingredients and what can be better to cook with simple ingredients which can be easily sourced. 
The batter for all recipes is pretty simple but the textures are very different and I love all of these recipes.
There are many other ingredients like besan (gram flour) which also can be cooked in different ways and will try to curate some recipe lists for all of you! 
Do try these easy to cook recipes with the same ingredient and the idea is that if you do not have fresh produce available in your locality, you can still cook some good food. 
Stay home, Stay safe!

7 Veg Paratha Ideas | 7 तरीके से बनाइये वेज पराठा | Chef Sanjyot Keer | #Lockdown #StayHome #Withme,"Hello people! So right now we have really less ingredients to prepare our meals and I am also not sure about what ingredients would be available where. That is why I have been curating lists of recipe ideas which you could prepare according to the availability of ingredients in your region. As I have been suggesting & telling you all that don’t be stuck with any recipe, just move on, substitute ingredients or just skip a few, it completely works in these circumstances. Like if you do not have the fresh mint & coriander its fine. 
A few substitutions recommended by me would be like in the paneer paratha you could make some fresh paneer at home quickly and use it for the paratha as fresh vegetables are not available in many regions like mine. Potatoes stay for long and I have included two different paratha ideas in this list. Soya kheema paratha also turns out to be really good & is really healthy as well as the daal paratha, you could also prepare this daal & have it with chapati, just leave it a little loose. Left over daal can be used to make sandwiches, I just love them & prepare toast sandwiches out off the leftover daal. The mix veg paratha is a tricky one from the list because now fresh veggies are not available but what you could do is that just see what you have and mix & make parathas. It is just about the idea of cooking, you can prepare so many recipes with simple ingredients. 
Do try the recipes if you have the ingredients & if you are cooking any recipes click on the links below to see the complete recipe video with Witten recipes. Stay safe

7 VEG FRANKIE IDEAS | 7 तरीके से बनाइये वेज फ्रैंकी | Chef Sanjyot Keer,"During this lock down we are craving a lot of that chatpata street food, (I am craving it a lot, can’t live with out it) and Frankie or rolls is one such recipe which is prepared with hundreds of different fillings be it veg or non veg. I have been trying to curate lists of ideas for each category of foods we are craving right now jus like is did 10 ideas to cook eggs. This is one is a list of veg Frankie ideas which I am sure you are going to drool over. All of these recipes are watched over millions of times by you and a lot of you have tried these recipes, this is for the viewers who have missed a few of these recipes or just to give you an idea of different veg frankies you can cook at home to satisfy your street food cravings. 
My personal favourite is the veg combination frankie which I used to have it in my college canteen and I used to love it, it may sound a little off that potato filling is mixed with noodles, but believe me it tastes awesome and this is another viral YFL recipe. 
I have included the ever famous frankie masala recipe in the beginning of the video, this is the main flavour in any frankie you prepare but if you are lazy you could use chaat masala (I would never do that but still, only if you’re lazy). I have also included two types of rotis in the beginning, one is the street style maida roti & the other one is just like our chapati. I like to prep it half cooked and then cook it gain before serving, nice and crispy. You could use any of the rotis as per your preference. 
There are 8 filling ideas in this compilation but I have many more ideas which are uploaded which are either non veg or egg based, you can check them out too. I know there would be a lot of ingredients in these ideas which would not be available right now, but you could surely add some other ingredient as a replacement or just omit that particular ingredient, don’t be stuck in a recipe, think how you can still make it and enjoy it! Just prepare any filling with whatever is available at home at this moment!!

LeftOver Chapati Pizza Recipe for LockDown | बंद में चपाती से पिज़्ज़ा बनाने का आसान तरीका,"So this recipe is always cooked for Iyan, quite a lot of you know him from my Your Food Lab junior series. If you haven’t watched it yet do have a look. He usually craves pizzas at unusual times and this is the easiest way to do it. I store some home-made pizza sauce in my fridge, I like to store it in ice cube trays as you can then remove a few cubes and thaw and use how much ever you require  & the rest can be stored back again. Otherwise the sauce takes really less time to prep. Then if we have chapatis from the day we use that or you can also make fresh chapatis which will work perfect. The pizzas turn out to be really crispy just like a thin crust pizza & is super easy to handle. High are easily available
You can use ready pizza sauce if you have some at home, make plain Margherita pizzas for your kids or you can also add toppings of your choice. As we under a lock down use whatever you have at home. If you are lazy you can also mix some ketchup with schezwan sauce and use it as the base sauce, sometimes I do that. If you have less tomatoes at home you can add some tomato ketchup to increase the sauce. 
Your kids won’t come to know that you have used chapati as the base & its super healthy. 
Also, Like I am mentioning in all my recipes, in a lock down we have to just think about options of ingredients we can use which are available at home. Like I have loads of olive oil at home, you can use normal oil as well. Be creative, you can sandwich cheese in between two chapatis to prepare a cheese burst version as well.

Prep time: 10 mins
Cooking time: 25 mins
Serves: 4

For homemade pizza sauce
Ingredients:
• Tomatoes 10 medium size
• Salt a pinch
• Olive oil 2 tbsp (Or any oil available, just don’t use mustardor a strong flavoured oil)
• Onion 1 medium size (chopped)
• Garlic 4-5 cloves (chopped) (Garlic powder works or you could skip this too)
• Sugar 1 tsp
• Red chilli flakes 2 tsp (You can use red chilli powder too)
• Oregano 2 tsp 
• Vinegar 1 tsp (You could use citric acid or lemon juice as well)

• Set water for boiling and add salt, make an “x” on each tomatoes head with a knife, cover & boil for 2-3 minutes. Transfer them to the ice-cold water and peel out the skin, further add them in a grinding jar and grind to a fine puree or you can also keep it chunky as per your preference. 
• Set a pan on medium heat, add olive oil, onions and garlic, sauté until onions are translucent.

• Freshly prepared homemade pizza
• Cheese as required
• Veggies for your choice

• Set a pan on medium heat, add olive oil and cook the pizza on low flame until the base is crisp and golden brown, cover it and cook so the cheese melts easily. If you have oven please feel free to bake at 200°C for 5 -8 mins or until cheese melts.
• Your thin crust pizza is ready to be served, slice into as many slices you would like to share with your mates. Enjoy this thin crust pizza with your family or mates in this quarantine without the guilt of missing those amazing pizzerias you usually love to eat out from!

Wash your hands thouroughly & stay safe! WHO #SafeHands challenge!,"Hello people! Hope everyone's in good health.

A lot has being going on since a couple of weeks. As humanity, we are going through a tough time. While we don't really have a solution to this what we can do as a collective measure is stay positive, stay home and stay clean. And while government institutes, and relevant organizations are all doing their due in dealing with the situation, I took up the WHO #SafeHands challenge as a way to educate everyone about safe hand washing and hand rubbing techniques, that is fundamental towards self-containment of germ exposure influence. 

This is the least we could do for the people around us, our family and friends. So stay home as much as possible and wash your hands as frequently as possible. Prayers for the lives lost and for the people who are infected and are fighting. Hoping that we overcome this situation very soon.

 Stay safe. Stay positive.

• Water 1.5 litre
• Vinegar / lemon juice 3 tbsp
• Milk (full-fat) 3 litres
• Fresh cream 3/4th cup

Methods:
• Mix vinegar / lemon juice with water.

• Hang the paneer and allow its whey to drain completely, do not squeeze with hands as its hot.
• Wash the paneer completely with fresh water to remove the sour taste that came with use of vinegar / lemon juice.
• Use a colander and place paneer in the muslin cloth itself and place a heavy object over it, so the excess moisture in the paneer drains out and milk solids come together to form a big paneer block. Keep the heavy weight for at least 1 hour.
• Your fresh soft homemade malai paneer is ready, use accordingly.

8. Hari elaichi (green cardamom) 2-3 nos.
• Fresh coriander leaves 1 tbsp (chopped)
• Fresh mint leaves 1 tbsp (chopped)
• Salt to taste
Methods:
• Set water for boiling in a stockpot, add ghee, whole spices, freshly chopped coriander and mint leaves & salt to taste, mix and add the soaked basmati rice, boil & cook the rice until its 90 % done.
• Strain the rice and spread it over a large size plate and cool down to room temperature.

For marinating chicken
Ingredients:
• Chicken 1 kg
• Salt to taste
• Lemon juice 1 tsp
• Curd 400 gm
• Red chilli powder 1 tbsp
• Turmeric powder ½ tsp
• Ginger garlic paste 2 tbsp
• Green chilli paste 1 tsp
• Fried onions ½ cup
• Biryani masala 2 tbsp
• Fresh mint leaves a handful (roughly chopped)
• Fresh coriander leaves a handful (roughly chopped)
• Ghee 2 tbsp
Methods:
• Wash the rice grain with water 4-5 times or until the water is clear enough, soak it in fresh water for 45-50 minutes.
• For marinating chicken, take a mixing bowl and add the chicken pieces, further add all the remaining ingredients of marinade, mix well and keep it marinated for at least 1 hour.

For biryani
Ingredients:
• Ghee 2 tbsp
• Marinated chicken
• Cooked rice
• Fresh coriander leaves
• Fresh mint leaves
• Fried onions
• Saffron infused milk (soak saffron in warm milk)
• Live charcoal + ghee 
Methods:
• Set a wok or a kadhai on medium heat, add ghee and the marinated chicken, stir and cook the chicken until it starts to bubble and the curd leaves oil, this process might take about 10-12 minutes depending on the size of chicken, cook the chicken up to 90%.
• Once the chicken is cooked up to 90%, remove it in a bowl.
• Now, in the same pan that was used for cooking chicken, spread a layer of cooked rice, then add freshly chopped mint & coriander leaves, some fried onions and pour some saffron infused milk.
• Now, over the rice, spread a layer of cooked chicken along with its masala, repeat the addition of fresh coriander, mint leaves and fried onions, now, layer the remaining cooked rice over the chicken and place a live burning charcoal in a bowl and pour ghee over it, cover and smoke for 5 minutes to impart smoke flavour in biryani.
• Now as the biryani is smoked, add some more freshly chopped mint & coriander leaves, some fried onions, pour some saffron infused milk and pour some more ghee for the extra flavour or you could also use oil that was used for frying onions.
• As the layering and final addition of ingredients for the biryani is done, we need to give a dum, by placing a lid on the wok and seal the edges of the wok with a dough, and keep it on very low flame for 30 minutes, make sure you use a heavy bottom wok or place a tawa underneath to avoid burning of biryani.
• The biryani is ready to be served, serve it hot with some papad, chilled raita or some mirch ka salan along with it.

Oregano Seasoning Recipe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fbRuxisu9Q

Written recipe for Garlic breadstick

Ingredients:
 Warm water 1/4th cup
 Sugar 1 tbsp
 Yeast 1.5 tsp
 Refined flour 2 cups
 Milk powder 1 tbsp
 Salt ½ tsp
 Garlic paste 1 tbsp
 Black pepper 1/4th tsp
 Olive Oil / oil as required
 Butter to grease the tray
 Oregano seasoning
Methods:
 Add warm water in a cup, further mix, sugar and yeast and make sure the yeast dissolve in the water well, after few minutes you’ll find the mixture has turned frothy.
 In a big mixing bowl, add refined flour, milk powder, garlic paste and salt & pepper to taste, mix well, further add 3/4th cup warm water and the yeast mixture and mix well, knead a soft dough, add oil to the dough and knead well to make a smooth dough. Knead for 15-20 minutes or you could also choose to knead with a electric beater or a stand mixer.
 Apply oil on the surface to prevent the dough from drying, cover it with a damp cloth and rest the dough for 1.5 hours.
 You must have seen the dough has doubled in size, knead the dough once again to puncture the dough, divide the dough into equal size dough balls and rest them again for 15 minutes, make sure you apply oil on their surface, to prevent it from drying.
 Sprinkle some cornmeal or refined flour and flatten it with your hands, shape into an average size chapati, you can do it with hands no need of rolling pin.
 Sprinkle some oregano seasoning over the flattened dough and fold it in half.
 Grease the baking tray with butter and sprinkle some oregano seasoning, place the folded dough/uncooked bread and apply melted butter over it, sprinkle some more oregano seasoning over it and make incision over the bread.
 Bake the bread in a preheated oven at 250℃ for 15-18 minutes.
 Your garlic breadsticks are ready, cut with a knife over the incisions and serve hot with cheese dip.

For Chilli Paneer rolls:

For the roll dough:

• 1 cup refined flour
• pinch of salt
• 1 tbsp oil
• water as required

For the Chilli paneer

• 250 grams Paneer
• 1 tbsp garlic paste
• ½ tbsp ginger paste
• salt to taste
• ¼ tsp crushed black pepper
• 3 tbsp corn starch
• 1 tbsp vegetable oil
• 1 tbsp chopped garlic
• ½ tbsp chopped ginger
• ¼ cup chopped spring onion (white part)
• ¼ cup diced capsicum
• 1 tbsp soy sauce
• 2 tsp green chilli paste
• salt to taste
• ¼ tsp white pepper powder 
• 1 tbsp spring onion greens

For assembly and further cooking:

• Cabbage
• vegetable oil for frying

Steps:

For chilli paneer roll:

• In a bowl mix refined flour and salt. Now add water slowly and start combining refined flour and water.
• Once the refined flour comes together stop adding water and start kneading the dough nicely.
• We need a soft and strechy dough.
• Now once the dough starts to appear a little smooth add oil and knead again for 5 minutes, the whole process should take about 15-20 minutes of kneading.
• Now apply some more oil on top of the dough and cover with a damp cloth for atleast half and hour. This will ensure the gluten to form which will make the dough strechy.
• Now clean the boneless chicken and cut into thin strips.
• Add garlic paste, ginger paste, salt, pepper, corn starch, refined flour to the chicken and marinate the chicken for atleast 20 minutes.
• Now heat oil in a pan and fry the chicken until crispy.
• Drain the excess oil from chicken and keep aside.
• In a separate pan heat oil and set the pan on high flame. Add chopped ginger, garlic and onions. Saute for a minute.
• Now add in the sauces and seasonings and saute for a minutes.
• Now add the fried chicken and toss to coat the chicken with the sauce.
• Finish with finely chopped spring onion greens.
• Now in a pan prepare egg omlettes by lightly seasoning the eggs and beating them.
• Fry the eggs to make a thin omelette.
• Now divide the refined flor dough into small portions and roll out a very thin roundel of the dough.
• Remember that the dough roundel should be really thin.
• Now place the egg omlette on top of the rolled out dough, place some schezwan chicken in the middle.
• Now wrap into a roll.
• Heat oil onto a pan and fry the rolls on medium heat until golden brown.
• Cut the rolls and serve immediately.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRjNaDfLDIg

Fried Chicken won ton by Chef Sanjyot Keer,"Title: Chicken won ton
Serves 4 persons

Recipe By: Chef Sanjyot Keer

For chicken won ton:

• 1 cup refined flour
• a pinch of salt
• water as required
• more refined flour for dusting
• 250-gram boneless chicken
• 1 tbsp celery
• 2 tbsp spring onion greens
• 2 tbsp spring onions
• 3 tbsp chopped coriander
• salt to taste
• ½ tsp crushed black pepper
• ½ tsp soy sauce
• 1 tbsp. vegetable oil
• Vegetable oil for frying

For won ton dipping sauce:

• ¼ cup ketchup
• 2 tsp soy sauce
• 3 tbsp brown sugar
• 1 tbsp red chili sauce
• 1 tsp vinegar
• salt to taste
• ¼ tsp crushed white pepper
• ½ cup water
• Corn starch slurry – 2 tsp corn starch mixed with 2 tbsp. water


Steps:

For chicken won ton:

• For the wonton wrappers, ina bowl add refined flour and salt. Now slowly add water and knead the dough for the wonton wrapper. While slowly adding water knead the dough well, note here that we have to make a very firm dough for the wrappers other wise it would be difficult to shape the wontons later.
• Once the dough is ready cover the dough and let it rest for around 30 minutes.
• After 30 minutes knead the dough again for a couple of minutes and now the dough is ready to be rolled into wonton wrappers.
• Divide the dough into smaller protions. If you have a pasta machine handy then nothing like it, the process becomes really easy and fast. You can also roll out thin sheets using a rolling pin too.
• Cut into 3 inch squares. The wonton wraps should be really thin.
• Sprinkle some flour on top so that they don’t stick to each other.
• In a mixer grinder add all ingredients for the chicken filling and mince the chicken. 
• Now take a wonton wrapper and place some chicken filling in the middle.
• Wrap the wontons into a preffered shape.
• Heat oil in a deep pan, once the oil is hot fry the wontons until golden brown. Cook on a medium flame otherwise the wonton wraps would cook faster and the chicken filling would stay uncooked.

For won ton dipping sauce:

• Combine ketchup, soy sauce, brown sugar, red chili sauce, vinegar, salt to taste, crushed white pepper & water in a pan and bring to a simmer.
• Thicken the sauce by adding in corn starch slurry – mix 2 tsp corn starch mixed with 2 tbsp. water. Stir and simmer the sauce for another two minutes and serve with fried won tons.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7BgcsJ-hOQ

Recipe By: Chef Sanjyot Keer

For Paneer tikka marinade:

• ½ cup hung curd
• 1 tbsp. garlic paste
• 1 tsp red chili powder
• ½ tsp cumin powder
• 1 tsp amchur powder
• salt to taste
• ½ tsp garam masala
• ¼ tsp black salt
• 250-gram paneer (cottage cheese)
• ¼ cup deseeded tomatoes
• ¼ cup capsicum
• ¼ cup onion

For Pesto aalu tikka marinade:

• ½ cup hung curd
• 1 tbsp. garlic paste
• ¼ cup basil (Crushed into puree or paste)
• ½ tsp oregano
• ½ tsp black pepper powder
• ½ tsp red chili flakes
• salt to taste
• 2 tbsp. fresh coriander (Chopped)
• 2 tbsp. mint leaves (Chopped)
• 1 cup par boiled baby potatoes 

For Smoking (Dhungaar)

• Slice of onion
• Live charcoal
• 1 tsp ghee

Description:

For Paneer tikka marinade:

• In a bowl add all ingredients and give it a nice mix.
• Tip: Use hung curd: Curd tied in a muslin cloth to remove excess whey(the water thing that comes out from curd when you tie it in a fine cloth). This makes the curd thick and the marinade stays onto the cottage cheese and gives it a creamy texture.
• Add the cottage cheese and veggies and mix carefully.
• Marinate for at least 30 minutes for flavors to infuse properly.

For Pesto aalu tikka marinade:

• Mix all ingredients in a bowl and give it a nice mix.
• Add par boiled potatoes: boil potatoes until they are 75% done.
• Coat well with the marinade and keep marinated for 30 minutes.

For Assembly:

• Using a bamboo skewer skew the paneer and potatoes along with the veggies alternately.
• Now heat a grill pan and add some vegetable oil or ghee for grilling.
• Grill the skewers for 2-3 minutes on all sides.
• You do not need to cook for a long time as the potatoes are par boiled and paneer does not take a lot of time to cook.
• Once the tikkas are ready smoke the tikkas by placing a slice of onion and a live charcoal on top, now add some ghee so that smoke is released from the coal. Cover for 2-3 minutes to have the wonderful charred smoky flavor at home without a tandoor.
• Serve immediately with mint chutney.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTlnqrbT6yY
