Cooking made easier with the quickest recipe search and recommendation.
The recipes are from my favourite youtuber Sanjyot Keer who goes popularly by the name of YFL

## Current status
Dataset - Obtained via Youtube (Title, URL, and Recipes)
Data pre-processing - This work is in progress. Looking for an efficient LLM parser 
Application - Planning on a Flask based  (skeleton ready) frontend and a backend provided by API and hopefully a vector database to find recipes based on the ingredents you have at home or probably mood that you are looking for based on countries.
